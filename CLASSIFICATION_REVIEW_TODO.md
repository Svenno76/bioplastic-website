## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Additional verification)

These were identified in the initial audit but may need review:

### Large Diversified Companies (May operate multiple roles)
- [ ] **BASF** - Large conglomerate; verify bioplastics segment is producer-focused
- [ ] **Arkema S.A.** - Check if also does compounding or converting
- [ ] **Covestro** - Verify if pure resin producer or has other roles

### Ambiguous Descriptions (Need clarification)
- [ ] **Algenesis** - Confirm they only produce bioPolyurethane material, not finished products
- [ ] **AgroRenew** - Verify PHA production scope (resin vs. finished products)
- [ ] **Biome Bioplastics** - Confirm "for packaging" means end applications, not their products
