## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Risk: Data Availability for Emerging Companies
- **Level**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Focus initial profiles on companies with web presence; use alternative sources
- **Impact**: Some companies may have limited data; will be noted in research summary

### Risk: Timeline Delays
- **Level**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Modular approach allows phased delivery; flexible prioritization
- **Impact**: Can extend timeline without affecting Phase 2B completion

### Risk: Language Barriers
- **Level**: LOW-MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Translation tools; focus on English-language sources; note language limitations
- **Impact**: May require additional research time for non-English markets

### Risk: Company Status Changes
- **Level**: MEDIUM
- **Mitigation**: Verify company status at time of profile creation; note bankruptcy/acquisition risks
- **Impact**: Some companies may become inactive; updates may be required

### Risk: Incomplete Product Information
- **Level**: LOW
- **Mitigation**: Use multiple sources; estimate based on industry norms where needed
- **Impact**: Some profiles may have estimated rather than confirmed data; will be noted
