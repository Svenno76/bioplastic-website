**Power2Polymers Secures ISC3 Innovation Challenge Award for Sustainable Polymer Technology**

German start-up Power2Polymers has won the prestigious ISC3 Innovation Challenge Award 2025, recognizing its breakthrough approach to sustainable polymer manufacturing. Founded in 2024 as a spin-off from RWTH Aachen University, the company competed against 74 start-ups to claim the top prize for developing cost-effective, high-performance polymers that significantly reduce environmental impact. The award underscores growing industry momentum toward sustainable materials solutions in specialty applications.

## Funding Details

Power2Polymers secured the main ISC3 Innovation Challenge Award, endowed with €15,000, alongside recognition at the Impact Festival's Innovation category. The company is backed by European and German funding sources, supporting its development of patented polymer technology. Led by CEO Dr. Guido Schroer and a team of PhD-level scientists, Power2Polymers holds a broad patent portfolio spanning eight patent families, protecting its proprietary innovations.

## Strategic Use

The company's core innovation integrates polyoxymethylene (POM), a novel building block, into base polymers to create materials for lubricants, industrial adhesives, and sealants across automotive, electronics, and furniture industries. This technology reduces product carbon footprints by approximately 40% while offering superior material compatibility. Critically, Power2Polymers' polymers provide a PFAS-free alternative to conventional solutions, addressing regulatory bans on forever chemicals in the EU and USA. The recyclable materials can be derived from renewable raw materials, positioning the company at the forefront of sustainable chemistry innovation with applications across a $340 billion market.
