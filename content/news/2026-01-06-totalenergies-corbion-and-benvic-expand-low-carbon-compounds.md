**TotalEnergies Corbion and Benvic Expand Low-Carbon Biopolymer Compounds**

**TotalEnergies Corbion**, a 50/50 joint venture between TotalEnergies and Corbion, has partnered with **Benvic**, a thermoplastics compounder, to accelerate adoption of sustainable polylactic acid (PLA) compounds across multiple industries. The collaboration integrates TotalEnergies Corbion's Luminy® PLA into Benvic's Plantura® portfolio, creating biobased alternatives with significantly lower carbon footprints than conventional plastics. This strategic alliance targets automotive, healthcare, cosmetics packaging, household appliances, and electronics sectors.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership leverages complementary expertise: Benvic contributes technical compounding capabilities while TotalEnergies Corbion provides advanced PLA chemistry knowledge, brand recognition, and regulatory support. By combining Luminy® PLA with other biobased materials, the companies enhance performance and functionality of PLA compounds. The resulting materials offer sustainable alternatives to traditional plastics including ABS, PS, and PP. Both companies emphasize product optimization and direct customer engagement to establish PLA compounds as scalable solutions for original equipment manufacturers and brand owners.

## Expected Outcomes

This collaboration represents a significant shift in bioplastics adoption beyond traditional packaging applications. By positioning PLA compounds as viable solutions for durable goods, the partnership supports the global transition toward eco-friendly manufacturing practices. The initiative demonstrates PLA's versatility across diverse industrial sectors, potentially accelerating market acceptance and establishing new standards for sustainable material alternatives. TotalEnergies Corbion's established production facility in Rayong, Thailand, combined with Benvic's market presence, positions the companies to drive meaningful industry transformation toward circular economy principles.
