# Novamont Develops New Marine-Biodegradable Film

Novamont, the Italian bioplastics innovator, has successfully developed a new biodegradable film that completely breaks down in marine environments within six months, addressing one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.

## Technical Innovation

The new Mater-Bi formulation uses a proprietary blend of bio-based polymers that maintain strength and flexibility while ensuring rapid biodegradation in seawater.

## Applications

Target applications include agricultural mulch films, food packaging, and disposable items that might end up in marine environments.
