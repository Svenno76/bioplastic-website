Abundia Global Impact Group has taken a decisive step toward the commercialization of its advanced recycling infrastructure by appointing Burns & McDonnell to lead the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) for its new facility in Texas. The project focuses on converting mixed waste plastics into high-value chemical feedstocks and fuels, addressing critical gaps in current waste management systems.

## advancing Chemical Recycling Infrastructure

The selection of Burns & McDonnell, a global engineering, architecture, and construction firm, signals the transition of Abundia’s project from concept to concrete execution. The Texas facility utilizes proprietary technology capable of processing complex plastic waste streams that typically bypass traditional mechanical recycling routes. By breaking down polymers into their molecular constituents, the plant aims to produce sustainable feedstocks that can re-enter the circular economy, reducing reliance on virgin fossil resources.

The FEED phase is a critical juncture in industrial development. During this stage, Burns & McDonnell will define the technical requirements, project costs, and safety parameters necessary to move into the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) phase. The collaboration ensures that the facility is designed to meet rigorous environmental standards while maximizing operational efficiency.

## Closing the Loop on Plastic Waste

The Texas project represents a significant investment in the burgeoning chemical recycling sector. As global demand for recycled content in packaging and industrial applications rises, technologies that can handle contaminated or multi-layered plastics are becoming essential. Abundia’s approach seeks to divert significant tonnage from landfills, transforming what is currently an environmental liability into a commercially viable resource.

For Abundia, partnering with an established firm like Burns & McDonnell mitigates execution risk and accelerates the timeline for bringing these sustainable fuels and chemicals to market. The completion of the FEED package is expected later this year, paving the way for a final investment decision and subsequent construction.
