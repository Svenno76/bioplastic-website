## Details

TIPA Compostable Packaging, a global leader in flexible compostable solutions, along with its European subsidiary Bio4Pack, has announced the acquisition of Sealpap, a company specializing in recyclable paper-based packaging. This strategic move, dated November 14, 2025, marks a significant expansion of TIPA's sustainable packaging portfolio, enabling the company to offer both certified compostable technologies and recyclable coated paper solutions. Sealpap is known for producing recyclable, sealable coated papers used in various applications, from sugar sticks to rice packaging, and holds FSC® certification for its papers.

The acquisition is poised to help global brands address diverse product needs, achieve their environmental sustainability goals, and navigate the complexities of evolving EU regulations regarding packaging waste. TIPA's long-standing vision is to lead the industry toward truly circular packaging, a goal further cemented by integrating Sealpap's expertise in coated paper technologies.

## Impact

The integration of Sealpap's recyclable paper-based solutions with TIPA's existing compostable films and laminates creates a comprehensive offering for brands seeking high-performance, flexible packaging alternatives. This expanded portfolio provides customers with a broader choice of materials, ensuring they can select packaging that aligns with specific product requirements, environmental commitments, and regulatory mandates.

Daphna Nissenbaum, co-founder and CEO of TIPA, emphasized that joining forces with Sealpap allows TIPA to meet escalating customer demand with a wider range of materials while continuing to drive innovation and regulatory alignment. Robert van der Laan, owner of Sealpap, noted that this collaboration significantly advances Sealpap's ability to provide truly sustainable paper-based packaging, offering a strategic advantage to customers given the fast-approaching regulatory changes across Europe. This acquisition also strengthens TIPA's growth strategy and market position in the sustainable packaging sector across Europe and North America.
