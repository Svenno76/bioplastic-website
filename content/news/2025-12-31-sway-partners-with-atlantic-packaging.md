**Sway and Atlantic Packaging Advance Seaweed-Based Packaging Solutions**

Sway, a biomaterial innovation company, has partnered with Atlantic Packaging to scale seaweed-based biopolymer packaging across consumer markets. The collaboration makes Sway's home and industrially compostable polybags more widely accessible through Atlantic's sales team and New Earth Approved Catalog. This strategic alliance represents a significant step toward replacing conventional plastic packaging with regenerative alternatives that support ocean health and coastal communities.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership leverages Atlantic Packaging's printing and converting capabilities with Sway's proprietary seaweed-based material technology. Atlantic's Tabor City facility has already produced the Sway Polybag for high-profile projects, including Chris Benchetler's Grateful Dead 60th anniversary merchandise capsule, printed with sustainable inks on biobased film. Atlantic's flexibility to run diverse substrates—including emerging materials—enables rapid customer transitions to sustainable options without operational delays.

## Expected Outcomes

The partnership positions both companies to address the growing demand for plastic alternatives in flexible packaging markets. Sway's materials decompose into healthy soil after use, eliminating traditional plastic waste while supporting regenerative agriculture. Industry trials with J.Crew, MillerKnoll, and Le Club demonstrate real-world viability across distribution networks. By expanding accessibility through Atlantic's established infrastructure, the collaboration accelerates adoption of seaweed-based packaging, potentially transforming how brands approach sustainability and supporting the broader bioplastics industry's transition toward ocean-positive, compostable solutions.
