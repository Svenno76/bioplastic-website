Teknor Apex, a global leader in plastic material science solutions, has completed its acquisition of Danimer Scientific, a pioneering biodegradable biopolymer manufacturer headquartered in Bainbridge, Georgia. The transaction, finalized in May 2025 following Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, represents a $19 million strategic investment that consolidates two industry innovators committed to sustainable materials development. This acquisition significantly strengthens Teknor Apex's competitive position in the rapidly expanding bioplastics market while preserving Danimer's operational independence and mission-driven focus.

## Deal Structure

The acquisition was executed as a Section 363 sale under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with Teknor Apex designated as the stalking horse bidder. The transaction includes Danimer's fermentation-based production facilities, proprietary intellectual property portfolio, and operating assets across two U.S.-based sites spanning over 200,000 square feet. Danimer's extensive patent portfolio comprises more than 480 granted patents and pending applications across 20+ countries, covering manufacturing processes and biopolymer formulations.

## Strategic Implications

This acquisition positions Teknor Apex to accelerate development of biodegradable alternatives to conventional plastics, particularly through Danimer's proprietary Nodax® polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) technology, certified for marine and soil biodegradability. The combined entity gains enhanced capabilities in biopolymer resins, including PHAs and polylactic acid (PLA), enabling expanded market reach and customer solutions. By integrating Danimer's fermentation expertise with Teknor Apex's infrastructure and resources, the companies strengthen the PHA market's credibility while advancing circular economy objectives and helping customers achieve sustainability goals.
