## Details

Xampla has secured over $14 million in Series A funding to accelerate its mission of replacing single-use plastics with plant-based alternatives. The investment round was led by Emerald Technology Ventures, Europe's first specialist venture-backed fund targeting the full packaging lifecycle, alongside BGF, one of the UK and Ireland's largest growth capital investors, and Munich-based Matterwave Ventures. Existing investors Amadeus Capital Partners and Horizons Ventures also participated in the round.

The Cambridge-based materials innovation company develops Morro™ materials, a revolutionary range of plastic-free alternatives made from regenerative plant proteins. These materials are completely biodegradable and home compostable, offering a natural polymer alternative to conventional plastics. Over the next five years, the funding will enable Xampla to replace more than ten billion units of the most polluting single-use plastics, including plastic linings found in takeaway boxes, coffee cups, and sachets.

Xampla has already established commercial partnerships with major industry players including 2M Group of Companies, Huhtamaki, and Transcend Packaging. The company's Morro™ Coating has been deployed on food delivery boxes for Just Eat Takeaway and Bunzl Catering Supplies. Unlike plastic coatings, Morro™ Coating maintains cardboard recyclability while providing effective grease, oxygen, and moisture barriers. The company is also commercializing Morro™ films as soluble, food-safe alternatives to plastic PVA films in dishwasher tablets, laundry pods, and single-serve food products.

## Impact

This significant investment validates Xampla's technology as a scalable solution to the global plastic pollution crisis. With global plastic production estimated to reach one billion tonnes annually and less than 10% of plastic ever produced being recycled, the environmental urgency is clear. The 8 billion tonnes of plastics and microplastics now present in the global environment underscore the need for viable alternatives.

The funding will support Xampla's expansion into the Asia Pacific region while strengthening its presence in the UK and Europe. According to CEO Alexandra French, the investment represents "a major vote of confidence" in the company's revolutionary approach to making plastic "a material of the past." The company aims to establish its Morro-branded products as the world's go-to plastic replacement, combining environmental benefits with practical performance that works with existing manufacturing equipment, making adoption both accessible and capital efficient for industry partners.
