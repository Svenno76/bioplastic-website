## Details of the Thailand Expansion

NatureWorks, a prominent manufacturer of low-carbon polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymers, is making significant progress on the construction of its new fully integrated Ingeo™ PLA biopolymer manufacturing facility in Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand. The company anticipates the facility to commence full production in 2025. This expansion is a direct response to the escalating demand for Ingeo biopolymers across the Asia-Pacific region, reinforcing NatureWorks' commitment to this growing market.

The new complex will be fully integrated, encompassing lactic acid fermentation, lactide monomer production, and polymerization facilities. With an annual capacity of 75,000 tons of Ingeo biopolymer, the plant is designed to produce the complete portfolio of Ingeo grades, including high-performance materials suitable for high-heat applications. Critical equipment, such as the melt crystallizer, is already on-site to facilitate this diverse production. The facility will leverage locally sourced sugarcane as a renewable feedstock, with farms located within a 50-kilometer radius of the Nakhon Sawan site.

## Focus on Closed-Loop Sustainability

This strategic expansion by NatureWorks underscores its dedication to closed-loop sustainability. The company aims to provide customers with fully biobased, low-carbon biomaterials that offer unique performance attributes valued across global downstream packaging and fiber markets. The initiatives include a strong emphasis on carbon neutrality and enhanced biodegradability. The new facility is poised to support rapid growth in various markets, including 3D printing, nonwovens for hygiene products, compostable coffee capsules, tea bags, flexible packaging, and sustainable food serviceware. This investment highlights NatureWorks' ongoing efforts to expand the biobased materials market and reduce environmental impact through climate-friendly processes.
