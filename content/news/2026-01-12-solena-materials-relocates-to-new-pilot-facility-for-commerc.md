Solena Materials, a leader in the development of programmable protein-based materials, has officially announced its relocation to a state-of-the-art pilot facility. This strategic move marks a critical milestone in the company’s trajectory, signaling a shift from laboratory-scale experimentation to industrial-scale manufacturing. The new facility is purpose-built to house the advanced fermentation and spinning infrastructure required to produce Solena’s AI-designed protein fibers at scale.

## Revolutionizing Materials with Computational Design
Solena’s core innovation lies in its ability to harness artificial intelligence to design proteins from the ground up. By utilizing computational modeling, the company can "program" specific traits into its fibers—such as elasticity, tensile strength, or thermal regulation—mimicking the performance of high-end synthetics without the environmental cost of petrochemicals. These bio-based fibers are fully biodegradable and offer a circular solution for industries struggling with microplastic pollution and carbon-heavy supply chains.

The new pilot facility serves as a vital bridge between the lab and full-scale commercial factories. It allows Solena’s engineers to refine the precision of their bio-manufacturing processes, ensuring that the AI-designed sequences translate perfectly into physical textiles. The facility also expands the company's capacity to collaborate with luxury fashion houses and performance apparel brands that are eager to integrate sustainable alternatives into their upcoming collections.

## Paving the Way for a 2028 Launch
The relocation is timed to support an ambitious roadmap leading to a 2028 commercial product launch. By scaling production now, Solena can provide substantial quantities of material for industrial wear-testing and certification. This phase is vital for proving that protein-based materials can meet the rigorous durability standards of the modern textile market while remaining commercially viable.

As global regulations on synthetic waste and carbon emissions tighten, Solena’s expansion places them at the forefront of the burgeoning bio-economy. With the new facility now operational, the company is one step closer to making high-performance, planet-positive textiles a mainstream reality for consumers worldwide.
