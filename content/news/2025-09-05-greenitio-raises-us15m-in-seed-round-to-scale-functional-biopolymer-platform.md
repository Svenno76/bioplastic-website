Greenitio, a Singapore-based climate-tech startup founded in 2021, has secured US$1.5 million in seed funding to scale its functional biopolymer platform. The investment, announced recently, will accelerate production of high-performance, bio-based alternatives to petrochemicals and microplastics in cosmetics and personal care products. Backed by investors like Silver Strand, the round supports Greenitio's patented green chemistry process, which transforms natural feedstocks like mushrooms into vegan chitosan derivatives, addressing the EU's 2027 ban on over 500 microplastic ingredients.

## Funding Details

The US$1.5 million seed round was led by strategic investors recognizing Greenitio's proprietary computational platform, which analyzes petrochemical structures to design 1:1 biodegradable substitutes from a decade-built biomaterial database. Founded by CEO Amit Kumar Khan and CTO Susmita Roy—both PhDs in biomaterials—the company is supported by COO Didier Vermeiren's 20+ years in entrepreneurship. Funds will enhance manufacturing of flagship products like Chitosola (SPF-boosting for suncare), Chitobela (anti-aging/anti-acne), and Chitobe (UV-protective nourisher), all registered in global cosmetic databases and validated with Tier 1 brands.

## Strategic Use

This funding positions Greenitio to disrupt the bioplastics sector by slashing production carbon footprints by 87% via water-based, solvent-free processes—three times cheaper than rivals. Its material-agnostic platform enables expansion beyond cosmetics into packaging, agriculture, and coatings, replacing entire synthetic chemical classes with scalable, multifunctional biopolymers from agri-waste or seaweed. As beauty faces €12 billion losses from microplastic bans, Greenitio's drop-in solutions drive industry sustainability without performance trade-offs.
