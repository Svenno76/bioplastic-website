Avantium, a leading Amsterdam-based chemical technology company, and Logoplaste, a prominent packaging producer, have signed a capacity reservation agreement for Avantium's ReLeaf® bioplastic to drive high-performance packaging innovation. Announced recently, the deal secures Logoplaste's access to production capacity from Avantium's flagship FDCA plant in Delfzijl, Netherlands, accelerating the shift from petroleum-based plastics to plant-derived alternatives amid rising demand for sustainable materials.

## Collaboration Details

The agreement builds on Avantium's YXY® technology, which converts plant-based sugars into FDCA (furandicarboxylic acid), the key building block for ReLeaf®—a 100% plant-based, fully recyclable PEF (polyethylene furanoate) polymer with superior barrier properties for bottles, films, and packaging. Avantium's Delfzijl facility, the world's first commercial-scale FDCA plant with 5 kilotonnes annual capacity, is now operational, enabling reliable supply for partners like Logoplaste. This partnership leverages Avantium's pilot plants in Geleen and Delfzijl, supporting scalable commercialization and licensing strategies.

## Expected Outcomes

This collaboration signals a pivotal step for the bioplastics industry, fostering high-value applications in packaging and textiles while reducing carbon footprints compared to fossil-based PET. By prioritizing renewable feedstocks like non-food biowaste, it addresses scalability challenges and aligns with EU regulations promoting biobased plastics. Avantium CEO Tom van Aken emphasized launching ReLeaf® products to create long-term stakeholder value, potentially spurring broader industry adoption and job creation in green chemistry hubs. The deal positions both firms to meet growing consumer and regulatory demands for circular economy solutions.
