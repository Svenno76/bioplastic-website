Farrel Pomini has announced significant advancements and sustainability initiatives in biopolymer processing, reinforcing its leadership in continuous mixing technology. The company unveiled these innovations in late 2025, highlighting their commitment to greener manufacturing solutions from their base in Ansonia, Connecticut. These developments aim to address the growing demand for sustainable materials and efficient processing methods in the polymer industry, particularly focusing on biopolymers and recycled plastics.

## Product Innovation

Central to Farrel Pomini’s announcement is the enhancement of its Farrel Continuous Mixer (FCM™), a technology designed for energy-efficient, low-temperature processing of sensitive materials such as Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), and recycled plastics like PVC and recovered Carbon Black. Recent innovations include the introduction of a Dry Face Pelletizer (DFP) for safer, cost-effective rigid PVC processing and the High-Dispersion (HD) Rotor for superior material dispersion. Additionally, Farrel Pomini showcased the CPeX® Laboratory Compact Processor, which facilitates rapid product development and precise real-time color control in masterbatch production.

## Applications

These advancements have broad implications for the bioplastics industry, enabling more efficient mechanical and chemical recycling processes and improving the quality and sustainability of biopolymer compounding. Farrel Pomini’s technology supports the processing of delicate bio-based feedstocks and recycled materials with reduced degradation and energy consumption. Their continuous mixing systems also play a vital role in emerging plastic pyrolysis processes, converting waste plastics into valuable feedstocks for new materials. This positions Farrel Pomini as a key enabler in the circular economy, helping manufacturers meet environmental goals while maintaining high production standards.
