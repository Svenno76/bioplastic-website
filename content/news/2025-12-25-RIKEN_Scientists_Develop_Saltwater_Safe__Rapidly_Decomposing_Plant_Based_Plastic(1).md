## Details

Scientists at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS), under the leadership of Takuzo Aida, have achieved a notable breakthrough with the development of a novel plant-based plastic called 'carboxymethyl cellulose supramolecular plastic' (CMCSP). Announced on December 25, 2025, this innovative material is crafted from cellulose, the planet's most abundant organic compound, specifically carboxymethyl cellulose derived from wood pulp. It boasts strength and flexibility comparable to conventional petroleum-based plastics.

A key innovation of CMCSP lies in its ability to rapidly decompose in various natural environments, crucially including saltwater, without leaving behind harmful microplastics. This rapid degradation is attributed to a unique structure involving "salt bridges" formed between carboxymethyl cellulose and positively charged polyethylene-imine guanidinium ions. These bonds are designed to break down effectively in saline conditions. To overcome initial brittleness, the team successfully incorporated choline chloride, an FDA-approved food additive, as a plasticizer, enabling broad modulation of the material's mechanical properties from stiff to flexible.

## Impact

The development of CMCSP marks a substantial step forward in addressing the global crisis of plastic pollution, particularly microplastics that pervade ecosystems and human bodies. Unlike many existing "biodegradable" plastics that often fail to degrade sufficiently in marine environments or still produce microplastics, CMCSP offers a truly environmentally benign alternative. By utilizing common, inexpensive, and FDA-approved biodegradable ingredients, the researchers have ensured the material's suitability for practical, real-world applications, such as flexible packaging for items like fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the material demonstrates closed-loop recyclability using electrolytes, offering a sustainable lifecycle beyond simple decomposition. Professor Aida highlighted that this study brings their work to a more practical stage, paving the way for future applications to protect the Earth from plastic pollution.
