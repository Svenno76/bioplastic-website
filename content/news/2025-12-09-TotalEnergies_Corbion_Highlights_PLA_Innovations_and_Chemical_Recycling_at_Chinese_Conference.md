## Details

TotalEnergies Corbion, a leading global producer of Polylactic Acid (PLA), prominently featured its advanced Luminy® PLA solutions at the 11th International Conference on Bio-based and Biodegradable Materials Technology and Applications in Beijing, China, held from November 13-15. The conference, a key forum for bio-based innovation in China, gathered global experts, industry leaders, and policymakers to discuss new technologies, market trends, and circular solutions.

Mr. Chow Pin Tan, Vice President of Sales and Business Development at TotalEnergies Corbion, delivered a keynote address titled “Planting the Future with Polylactic Acid – New Solutions for Climate Challenges.” During his presentation, Tan underscored the exceptional properties of Luminy® PLA, emphasizing its certification as 100% biobased, recyclable, and industrially compostable. He presented case studies and third-party data illustrating how Luminy® PLA significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions—by up to 85% compared to conventional fossil-based plastics.

## Innovations and Impact

A key highlight of TotalEnergies Corbion's presentation was the successful chemical recycling of PLA using hydrolysis depolymerization technology. This breakthrough yields recycled PLA (rPLA) with performance comparable to virgin material and has achieved food-contact certification, establishing a robust technical pathway for a circular plastics economy. Tan noted that rPLA with 30% recycled content can achieve carbon neutrality, while products made from 100% recycled material can even attain a negative carbon footprint, aligning with global emission reduction goals.

The company also showcased diverse applications of Luminy® PLA, including its growing adoption in 3D printing as a mainstream choice due to its performance. Furthermore, an innovative collaboration with South Korean partner Sansu was highlighted, featuring a label-free PLA bottle designed to improve recycling efficiency by integrating branding through embossing, thus streamlining the sorting and cleaning processes. This initiative underscores TotalEnergies Corbion's commitment to advancing plastic industry sustainability through technological innovation and collaborative efforts across the value chain.
