BioBTX, a Dutch pioneer in renewable aromatics, has secured over €80 million in funding to construct the world's first commercial plant producing biobased BTX—benzene, toluene, and xylene—from plastic waste and biomass. Announced in June 2024, the facility at the PETRA Circular Chemicals Plant in Delfzijl, Netherlands, will process 20,000 tons of mixed plastic waste annually, advancing the nation's 100% circular economy goal by 2050.

## Funding Details

The €80 million investment supports BioBTX's proprietary Inductive Catalytic Continuous Pyrolysis (ICCP) technology, enabling large-scale conversion of end-of-life plastics—currently incinerated or landfilled—into high-value, drop-in aromatics compatible with existing chemical processes. This builds on prior milestones, including a €23 million Circular Aromatics project launched in April 2025 with partners like ExxonMobil Chemical Holland, Ketjen, and the Universities of Twente and Groningen. Earlier successes encompass 100% biobased PET production and Twaron aramid fiber demonstrations.

## Strategic Use

This plant marks the global debut of commercial-scale circular BTX, targeting a €100 billion aromatics market dominated by fossil feedstocks. By replacing petrochemicals with waste-derived alternatives, BioBTX slashes CO₂ emissions, reduces plastic waste, and supplies building blocks for bioplastics, high-performance polymers in electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and coatings. The technology fosters a seamless industry transition to sustainability, with plans for feedstock flexibility and further innovation, positioning BioBTX as a leader in circular chemistry.
