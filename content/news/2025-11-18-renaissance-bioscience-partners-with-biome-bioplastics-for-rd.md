Renaissance BioScience and Biome Bioplastics have launched a two-year, $1.06 million research and development partnership aimed at creating renewable plastic alternatives for packaging and personal care products. The collaboration, beginning in 2025, spans Canada and the UK and seeks to address plastic pollution by developing sustainable bioplastics that reduce reliance on fossil fuels. This initiative is supported by government funding from the National Research Council of Canada and UK Research and Innovation’s Innovate UK.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership focuses on leveraging advanced microbial engineering and fermentation technologies to produce bio-based building blocks for bioplastics. Renaissance BioScience, known for its expertise in bioengineered yeast, will work alongside Biome Bioplastics, a leader in sustainable materials development, to optimize strain engineering and fermentation processes. The project includes trials and process optimization in both countries, culminating in the production of test samples for global partners in packaging and personal care sectors. The goal is to establish a scalable, cost-effective method for manufacturing renewable plastics that meet performance standards.

## Expected Outcomes

This collaboration aims to accelerate the transition from petroleum-based plastics to renewable bioplastics, contributing to environmental sustainability and reducing plastic pollution. By combining biology and materials science, the project is expected to strengthen the bioplastics industry in Canada and the UK, positioning both countries as leaders in the growing sustainable chemicals market, projected to exceed $39 billion by 2034. The partnership underscores the increasing demand for high-performance, eco-friendly alternatives in consumer goods and packaging industries.
