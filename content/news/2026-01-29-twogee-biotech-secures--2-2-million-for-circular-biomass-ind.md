German innovator **Twogee Biotech** has announced the successful closing of a €2.2 million Seed funding round. The fresh capital will be utilized to accelerate the industrialization of the company’s proprietary technology, which focuses on transforming organic residues into high-value bio-based chemicals and materials.

## Unlocking the Potential of Second-Generation Biomass

The core of Twogee Biotech’s innovation lies in its approach to "second-generation" (2G) feedstocks. Unlike first-generation bioplastics that rely on food crops like corn or sugarcane, Twogee’s platform is designed to process agricultural residues and organic waste streams. By valorizing these low-value inputs, the company addresses the "food-versus-fuel" debate while offering a carbon-neutral alternative to fossil-based chemical production.

The funding round was led by **High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF)**, a prominent early-stage investor in European deep tech. The investment signals strong market confidence in technologies that enable the transition from a linear to a circular bioeconomy.

## Scaling Up Operations

With the €2.2 million injection, Twogee Biotech plans to advance its technology readiness level significantly. The primary focus will be on upscaling their bioprocesses from the laboratory to a continuous industrial demonstration scale. This step is critical for validating the economic viability of their production methods and securing commercial partnerships with chemical compounders and bioplastic manufacturers.

The funds will also support the expansion of the company’s R&D team and the optimization of their fermentation protocols to ensure higher yields and process stability.

## A Step Toward Circular Chemistry

As the European Union tightens regulations regarding carbon emissions and resource efficiency, the demand for bio-based building blocks is surging. Twogee Biotech aims to position itself as a key technology provider in this value chain, offering a scalable solution that turns waste into essential raw materials for the plastic and chemical industries.
