## Details
FORVIA, a global automotive technology leader, has announced its provision of advanced and sustainable interior solutions for the all-new Renault Clio 6. These key interior components, specifically the instrument panel and center console, incorporate 40% recycled plastics, demonstrating a significant step towards more eco-friendly automotive manufacturing. This initiative aligns with Renault's broader sustainability objectives and FORVIA's commitment to developing smarter, more sustainable mobility solutions.

The supplied solutions highlight FORVIA's expertise in plastic injection molding and sophisticated surface finishing techniques. The instrument panel features textile-covered trims, available in Alcantara or fabric, achieved through automated 3D modeling and robotic processes for consistent quality and a refined tactile finish. Additional decorative elements include laser-grained textures and chrome-effect inserts to enhance visual appeal and tactile perception. The center console introduces a new magnetic foldable cover, offering a smart, modular, and enclosed storage solution for the cup holder area. Furthermore, integrated light-guides provide uniform ambient lighting, contributing to an enhanced in-vehicle experience.

## Impact
The production of these components is strategically located at FORVIA's Orhangazi plant in Turkey, in close proximity to Renault's manufacturing site. This localized production helps streamline logistics and reduce the overall carbon footprint associated with transportation. By combining technical know-how, significant use of recycled materials, and refined design features, FORVIA delivers high-quality and visually appealing interior solutions that meet demanding quality and safety standards while supporting the shift towards sustainable automotive practices. This collaboration underscores FORVIA's dedication to industrial excellence and enhanced user experience through innovative and sustainable technologies.
