## Details

CJ Biomaterials, a global leader in the production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers, announced a strategic partnership with BIQ Materials, a Swedish biomaterials compounding company, on November 5, 2025. This collaboration aims to accelerate the commercialization of patented artificial turf infill made with PHACT™ PHA, a certified biodegradable biopolymer, specifically for the European market. The agreement, signed on October 30th, positions both companies to proactively address the anticipated surge in demand for sustainable alternatives following the European Union's 2031 ban on petroleum-based infill, which is classified as an intentionally added microplastic under REACH Regulation 1907/2006.

CJ Biomaterials will supply its PHACT™ PHA A1000P material to BIQ Materials, which will then use it to manufacture environmentally friendly infill products. PHACT™ PHA A1000P is an amorphous PHA (aPHA), a softer, more rubbery version of PHA, offering unique performance characteristics. It is a 100% bio-based material, produced by microbial fermentation of sugar, and is certified biodegradable in industrial compost, soil (ambient), and marine environments. Notably, it is also TUV Certified as 'home compostable'. The material's ability to completely biodegrade without leaving persistent microplastics makes it a viable replacement for petroleum-derived plastics.

## Impact

This partnership marks a significant step towards combating microplastic pollution originating from artificial turf fields across Europe. The current petroleum-based infill materials are a major contributor to persistent microplastics in the environment. By offering a fully biodegradable alternative, CJ Biomaterials and BIQ Materials are helping sports fields transition to more sustainable practices. CJ Biomaterials' PHACT™ PHA A1000P polymer has already garnered recognition, winning the 2025 Bioplastics Awards Innovation Award from the Plastics Industry Association for its application in infill. The collaboration not only addresses an urgent environmental concern but also aims to accelerate the broader commercialization of PHA as a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics. BIQ Materials, known for developing and manufacturing degradable biomaterials free of permanent microplastics, further strengthens the initiative with its expertise in compounding and focus on circular, smart bio-based plastic solutions.
