## Details
Braskem Siam, a joint venture between global biopolymer leader Braskem and SCG Chemicals, has formally entered into a Letter of Intent with Mitr Phol Bio Fuel for the supply of agricultural-based ethanol. This strategic agreement ensures a stable and competitive feedstock source for Braskem Siam's forthcoming bio-ethylene plant in Thailand, marking a significant step in sustainable plastics production in Asia. The facility, poised to be the first of its kind outside Brazil, is anticipated to commence operations by 2027 and will require an estimated 450 million liters of ethanol annually. Mitr Phol Bio Fuel, a subsidiary of the Mitr Phol Group and ASEAN's leading ethanol producer, is renowned for its commitment to sustainability across its value chain.

## Impact
The bio-ethylene plant in Thailand is projected to almost double Braskem's existing global production capacity of its I'm green™ bio-based polyethylene. This expansion is crucial for meeting the escalating demand for sustainable products in both Asian and European markets. The bio-based polyethylene, derived from ethanol (often from sugarcane, cassava, or corn), offers a significantly reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional fossil fuel-based plastics and is fully recyclable. Braskem Siam plans to implement a Responsible Ethanol Sourcing Program in Thailand, mirroring Braskem Brazil's robust sustainability framework, which encompasses stringent standards for land use, water management, waste disposal, and labor practices. This collaboration not only strengthens Thailand's ethanol value chain but also supports the nation's low-carbon economic goals, solidifying its role in the global bioplastics industry.
