## Details
Blue Circle Olefins and Ducor Petrochemicals have formally announced a strategic partnership to forge a comprehensive circular value chain for polypropylene (PP). This collaboration aims to jointly produce and market segregated bio-polypropylene and carbon-recycled polypropylene, addressing the growing industrial demand for sustainable material solutions. The initiative is poised to significantly reduce the environmental footprint associated with traditional plastic production, with an ambitious target of over 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional oil-derived polyolefins.

Central to this partnership is Blue Circle Olefins' development of a 200-kiloton Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) facility in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, slated to be operational by 2030. This advanced facility will convert green methanol, sourced from mixed plastic waste or biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues, into high-quality, fossil-free bio-based and carbon-recycled ethylene and propylene. These olefins are essential building blocks for circular plastics production. Ducor Petrochemicals contributes its extensive experience in producing sustainable polypropylene solutions tailored for demanding applications, coupled with flexible, customer-focused production assets.

## Impact
The partnership leverages the complementary expertise of both companies to serve a broad range of industries, including healthcare, life sciences, automotive, engineering, electrical appliances, packaging, and household goods, all seeking more environmentally responsible material options. Ralph Koekkoek, CEO of Blue Circle Olefins, highlighted the agreement as a pivotal step for their MTO project, enabling the joint offering of a diverse portfolio of polypropylene grades produced from recycled or 100% bio-based propylene. Hanno Schouten, CEO of Ducor Petrochemicals, reinforced the commitment to Europe's transition to circular materials, stating that the collaboration will enable customers to achieve a seamless shift towards 100% circular polypropylene by 2030. This strategic alliance underscores a significant move towards accelerating the industry's adoption of low-carbon, fully circular materials.
