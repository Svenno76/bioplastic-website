WEG, a German biotechnology company founded in 2019, has secured €16 million in Series A funding led by Axeleo Capital's Green Tech Industry Fund to scale biodegradable alternatives to microplastics. The investment, announced on September 16, 2025, brings the startup's total funding to €22 million and will fund its first industrial bacterial cellulose plant in Germany, accelerating commercialization across Europe amid tightening EU regulations phasing out fossil-based microplastics by 2028.

## Funding Details

The round included participation from EIC Fund, NBank Capital, BonVenture, and seed investor Dr.-Ing. Frank Jenner. BIOWEG, co-founded by Dr. Prateek Mahalwar and Srinivas Karuturi, converts food-industry side streams like potato, beer, and sugar waste into high-purity bacterial cellulose via precision fermentation and green chemistry. It currently operates a pilot plant in Quakenbrück (up to six tonnes capacity) and a lab on Bayer Crop Science’s Monheim campus. CEO Mahalwar stated, “Today’s funding allows us to move decisively into industrial manufacturing and support customers transitioning away from microplastics.”

## Strategic Use

This capital enables BIOWEG to transition from pilot to industrial scale, co-locating the new facility with a major German sugar producer for feedstock synergies and cost efficiency. Its portfolio—Micbeads for cosmetics (replacing PMMA/nylon), RheoWeg for rheology in personal/home care, and AgriWeg for seed/fertilizer coatings—offers drop-in, high-performance substitutes outperforming fossil polymers in sensory and functionality. As Europe mandates microplastic-free supply chains, BIOWEG addresses surging demand in cosmetics, agriculture, and pharma, supporting circular economy goals and reducing ocean/soil pollution.
