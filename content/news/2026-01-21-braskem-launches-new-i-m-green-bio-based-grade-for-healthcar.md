## A Sustainable Leap for Medical Manufacturing

In a move that signals a significant shift toward circularity in the medical industry, Braskem has officially unveiled its latest innovation: a new bio-based grade within its renowned **I’m green™** portfolio. Specifically designed for the healthcare sector, this new grade made its debut at Pharmapack 2026 in Paris, highlighting the company’s commitment to reducing the carbon footprint of high-stakes pharmaceutical applications.

The healthcare industry has long faced a paradox: the necessity for single-use plastics to ensure sterility and safety, contrasted with the growing global urgency to reduce plastic waste and fossil fuel dependency. Braskem’s new bio-based polyethylene (PE) aims to bridge this gap, offering a renewable alternative that does not compromise the rigorous safety standards required for medical devices and packaging.

## Performance Meets Renewability

The new I’m green™ healthcare grade is derived from sugarcane ethanol, a renewable feedstock that captures CO2 during its growth cycle. Unlike traditional plastics derived from petroleum, this bio-based resin provides a significantly lower carbon profile. Crucially for manufacturers, it serves as a "drop-in" solution. This means it possesses the same physical and chemical properties as conventional fossil-based polyethylene, allowing pharmaceutical companies to transition to more sustainable materials without needing to invest in new machinery or alter existing production processes.

The grade is engineered to meet stringent regulatory requirements, ensuring high purity, chemical resistance, and compatibility with various sterilization methods. This makes it an ideal candidate for applications ranging from secondary packaging to components of medical devices.

## Decarbonizing the Global Supply Chain

By introducing this grade at Pharmapack, Braskem is positioning itself as a key partner for healthcare companies striving to meet ambitious ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) goals. As the medical industry faces increasing pressure from both regulators and consumers to adopt greener practices, the availability of high-performance bioplastics is expected to accelerate the adoption of sustainable design in life sciences.

This launch reinforces Braskem's position as a global leader in biopolymers, proving that even the most demanding sectors can transition toward a bio-based economy without sacrificing quality or patient safety.
