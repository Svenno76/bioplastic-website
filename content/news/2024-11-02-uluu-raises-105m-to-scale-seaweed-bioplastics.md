Australian bioplastics startup Uluu has raised A$16 million (US$10.5 million) in Series A funding to build a demonstration facility and scale its innovative technology for producing PHA bioplastics from seaweed. The Perth-based company aims to provide a sustainable, fossil-free alternative to petroleum-based plastics, targeting industries from packaging to automotive and fashion.

## Funding Details

The investment round was led by Burda Principal Investments, with participation from Main Sequence, Novel Investments, Startmate, and a consortium of impact and family investors, including Fairground and Trinity Ventures. The capital will be used to construct a 10-tonne-per-year demonstration plant in Western Australia, marking a critical step toward commercial-scale production. Uluu’s technology uses farmed seaweed and saltwater fermentation to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are biodegradable, recyclable, and marine-safe.

## Strategic Use

Uluu’s seaweed-based bioplastics offer a scalable, climate-positive alternative to conventional plastics, with the potential to sequester or avoid up to 5kg of CO₂ equivalent per kilogram of material produced. The demonstration plant will enable Uluu to supply commercial-grade material to global partners, including Quiksilver, Papinelle, and Audi, supporting staged trials and paving the way for long-term offtake agreements. The technology’s compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure makes it a practical solution for reducing plastic pollution and carbon emissions across multiple sectors. Uluu’s progress signals a major advancement in the bioplastics industry, positioning seaweed as a key feedstock for sustainable material innovation.
