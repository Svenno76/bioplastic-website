Researchers at the **University of Rochester** have announced a significant advancement in chemical recycling technology, demonstrating that tungsten carbide can serve as an effective, low-cost substitute for noble metals in the upcycling of plastic waste. The breakthrough addresses one of the primary economic barriers to the circular economy: the high reliance on expensive platinum group metals (PGMs) like platinum and iridium for catalytic processes.

## A Cost-Effective Alternative to Noble Metals

The research team focused on the process of dehydrogenation, a critical chemical reaction used to convert saturated hydrocarbons found in plastic waste into unsaturated olefins. These olefins serve as valuable building blocks for producing new plastics, fuels, and industrial chemicals. Historically, this transformation required catalysts made from scarce and volatilely priced noble metals.

By synthesizing a catalyst based on tungsten carbide, the Rochester team has successfully replicated the electronic properties of platinum. Often referred to as "synthesized platinum," tungsten carbide offers similar catalytic efficiency at a fraction of the raw material cost. This modification significantly reduces the capital expenditure required for large-scale chemical recycling facilities.

## Enhancing the Circular Economy

This development holds particular promise for the treatment of polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, which constitute a vast majority of global plastic waste. The tungsten carbide catalyst facilitates the selective breaking of Carbon-Hydrogen bonds, allowing for the recovery of high-purity monomers without the rapid deactivation often seen in base metal catalysts.

## Commercial Implications

While currently at the laboratory scale, the University of Rochester is exploring pathways to scale the technology for industrial application. By lowering the operational costs associated with catalyst regeneration and replacement, this innovation could make chemical recycling a more competitive alternative to the production of virgin plastics from fossil fuels. The research represents a pivotal step toward sustainable petrochemical processes that do not rely on scarce resources.
