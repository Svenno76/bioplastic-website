TotalEnergies is spearheading a significant transformation of its Grandpuits platform in France, converting it into a zero-crude facility set to be operational by mid-2025. This ambitious project, backed by an investment exceeding €500 million, underscores the company's commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainable energy solutions. The initiative, announced in September 2020, will see the former refinery pivot towards a diversified portfolio of future-oriented activities.

## Details

The Grandpuits platform will become a hub for sustainable energy and circular economy initiatives. Key activities include biofuel production, with a strong emphasis on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), plastic waste recycling, renewable hydrogen generation, biomethane production, and solar energy development.

The biorefinery at Grandpuits, with a processing capacity of 400,000 metric tons per year, is expected to produce 210,000 metric tons of SAF annually, increasing to 285,000 metric tons from 2027. Over 75% of the feedstock for this SAF production will come from waste and residues, with a partnership with SARIA securing supplies of used cooking oils and animal fats. The site is poised to become France's first advanced plastics recycling plant, a joint venture (60% TotalEnergies, 40% Plastic Energy) capable of converting 15,000 metric tons of plastic waste annually into pyrolysis oil through chemical recycling. This pyrolysis oil will then serve as feedstock for polymers with properties identical to virgin plastics, including food-grade applications. Additionally, a mechanical recycling unit, scheduled for 2026, will produce 30,000 tons per year of high value-added compounds containing up to 50% recycled plastic material, targeting the high-performance packaging market. TotalEnergies aims to produce 1 million tons of circular polymers by 2030, with agreements like the one with Paprec securing plastic waste supply.

## Impact

The Grandpuits project is a cornerstone of TotalEnergies' strategy to become a multi-energy company and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. By diversifying into biofuels, circular polymers, and renewable energies, the platform will significantly contribute to decarbonizing sectors such as aviation and packaging. The conversion also ensures the maintenance of 250 jobs at the site, reflecting the company's dedication to its commitments. The integration of a CO2 capture unit further enhances the platform's environmental benefits, reducing its carbon footprint by over 110,000 tons of CO2 per year. This comprehensive transformation positions Grandpuits as a leading example of industrial transition towards a sustainable, zero-crude future.
