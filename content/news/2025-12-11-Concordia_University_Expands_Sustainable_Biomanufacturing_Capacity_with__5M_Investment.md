Concordia University has significantly bolstered its sustainable biomanufacturing capabilities through substantial upgrades to its Genome Foundry and Bioprocessing facilities, backed by a $5 million Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) Innovation Fund investment. This funding, matched by Quebec's Ministry of Higher Education (MES), solidifies Concordia's standing as a premier Canadian center for synthetic biology and bioprocessing. The enhancements are designed to accelerate the development of greener chemicals, bioplastics, sustainable biofuels, and new medicines, transforming sectors such as health, agriculture, and clean energy.

## Details
The $5 million investment has been directed towards upgrading the university's integrated facilities, which now enable researchers to develop bio-based products from initial design of microbial and mammalian cells to testing and refining. These upgrades include the construction of a containment level 1 laboratory, installation of new fermentation equipment, and enhancements to microfluidics labs. The Genome Foundry, established in 2016 with a CFI grant, has evolved into a national hub for synthetic biology, utilizing cutting-edge robotic instrumentation to execute work at significant scales and speeds.

## Impact
The expanded facilities are poised to foster innovation by providing advanced infrastructure to small- and medium-sized enterprises, academic partners, and government collaborators. This access is expected to shorten the path from discovery to market and support the creation of high-skilled jobs. The university's biomanufacturing efforts specifically aim to reduce reliance on petrochemicals, minimize waste, and develop scalable technologies for sustainable food, therapeutics, and materials like bioplastics, contributing significantly to greenhouse gas emission reduction. Steve Shih, co-director of the Centre for Applied Synthetic Biology, emphasizes that these upgraded facilities will allow researchers and partners to move faster and scale promising technologies into real-world applications.
