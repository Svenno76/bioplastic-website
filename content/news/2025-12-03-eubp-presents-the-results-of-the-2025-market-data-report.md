European Bioplastics unveiled its Bioplastics Market Development Update 2025 in December at the European Bioplastics Conference (EBC25) in Berlin, revealing accelerating growth in the global bioplastics sector. The report projects that global bio-based plastics production capacity will double from 2.31 million tonnes in 2025 to approximately 4.69 million tonnes by 2030, demonstrating robust market momentum driven by regulatory pressures and consumer demand for sustainable materials.

## Background

The market data, compiled by European Bioplastics in cooperation with the nova-Institut, shows that packaging remains the largest application segment, accounting for 41.3% of the bioplastics market. Europe is experiencing particularly strong growth, with production capacity expected to increase from 330,000 tonnes per year in 2025 to 800,000 tonnes by 2030. This expansion is largely driven by increases in bio-polyethylene (bio-PE) and bio-polypropylene (bio-PP) production, reflecting the region's commitment to advancing its manufacturing base. Despite representing only 0.5% of global plastic production, bioplastics are positioned to expand across diverse sectors including automotive, consumer goods, and agricultural applications.

## Significance

The projected growth underscores bioplastics' critical role in Europe's circular economy transition. Managing Director Hasso von Pogrell emphasized that continued progress depends on stable policy frameworks, noting that the European Commission's renewed bioeconomy strategy now explicitly recognizes bioplastics as part of its industrial strategy. This policy alignment, combined with rising consumer awareness of plastic pollution and strengthening regulatory frameworks globally, positions bioplastics as indispensable materials for manufacturers and investors committed to environmental innovation.
