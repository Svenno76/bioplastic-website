## Opening

**Emirates Biotech has launched Embio, a new line of PolyLactic Acid (PLA) biopolymers designed to offer a sustainable alternative to traditional plastics.** Announced in November 2025, the product range marks a significant milestone for the Dubai-based company in making renewable and compostable plastics accessible across the Middle East. The Embio portfolio reflects Emirates Biotech's commitment to biotechnology and sustainability while supporting the UAE's Net Zero 2050 agenda and circular economy goals.

## Product Innovation

The Embio range features multiple PLA grades engineered for high clarity, strength, and processability with a substantially lower carbon footprint than conventional plastics. Each grade has been carefully developed and tested to ensure compliance with food-contact, bio-based, and compostability standards. The material can be recycled or industrially composted without leaving persistent microplastics in the environment, supporting waste reduction and circularity objectives. Notably, Embio grades are designed to run smoothly on existing processing equipment, enabling seamless transitions for manufacturers.

## Applications and Market Impact

The Embio portfolio encompasses PLA grades suitable for rigid and flexible packaging, coated paperboard, fibers, nonwovels, and 3D printing applications. By maintaining local inventory in the UAE, Emirates Biotech enables regional converters, brand owners, and packaging manufacturers to access smaller volumes with shorter lead times and reduced minimum order quantities. This localized approach accelerates adoption of plant-based materials across the Middle East, positioning the company as a key enabler of the region's transition toward sustainable, biobased production systems.
