CJ Biomaterials has entered a strategic partnership with BIQ Materials to produce artificial turf infill using PHACT™ PHA, a certified biodegradable biopolymer. Announced in early November 2025, this collaboration targets the European market, aiming to provide sustainable alternatives that comply with the EU’s upcoming microplastic ban. The partnership reflects both companies’ commitment to advancing eco-friendly materials in sports and landscaping applications.

## Collaboration Details

Under this agreement, CJ Biomaterials will supply PHACT™ PHA, an amorphous polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) known for its biodegradability in industrial compost, soil, and marine environments. BIQ Materials will integrate this biopolymer into artificial turf infill products, replacing conventional plastic-based materials that contribute to microplastic pollution. The partnership leverages CJ Biomaterials’ expertise in producing high-performance, bio-based polymers through proprietary fermentation technology and BIQ’s experience in sustainable turf solutions, aiming to meet stringent European environmental regulations.

## Expected Outcomes

This collaboration is significant for the bioplastics industry as it addresses the growing regulatory pressure to eliminate microplastics from consumer products. By introducing PHACT™ PHA-based turf infill, the partnership supports circular economy principles, offering a fully biodegradable alternative that reduces environmental impact. It also highlights CJ Biomaterials’ leadership in scaling amorphous PHA production and expanding applications beyond packaging into durable goods. The initiative aligns with broader industry trends toward sustainable materials that combine performance with ecological responsibility, potentially setting new standards for artificial turf products in Europe and beyond.
