P2 Science, Inc., a pioneer in green chemistry and sustainable materials based in Woodbridge, Connecticut, has partnered with Algenesis Corporation, a San Diego-based leader in bio-based polyurethanes, to develop and commercialize 100% biobased, biodegradable polyurethane materials. Announced in November 2025, this strategic collaboration combines two complementary technological platforms to create high-performance alternatives to petroleum-based polymers, addressing growing demand for sustainable solutions across multiple industries.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership leverages P2 Science's proprietary **PIOz™ (Process Intensified Ozonolysis) technology**, which converts algae-derived oils into advanced chemical intermediates. P2 is currently synthesizing algae-based azelaic acid at its Naugatuck, Connecticut manufacturing facility, supplying Algenesis with a critical raw material for polymer production. Algenesis contributes its recently commissioned **Bio-Iso™ pilot plant** and cutting-edge bio-polyurethane platforms, converting these intermediates into next-generation biodegradable polyurethane systems. The collaboration eliminates reliance on toxic phosgene and petrochemical content.

## Expected Outcomes

This partnership accelerates the transition toward sustainable materials by establishing a new chemical and polymer supply chain for biodegradable polyurethanes suitable for footwear, apparel, coatings, adhesives, and consumer products. The resulting materials deliver high performance without microplastic generation, supporting environmental remediation efforts. Both companies are committed to scaling production capacity to make plant-derived chemicals and bio-polyurethanes widely accessible to global markets. The collaboration represents a significant advancement in eliminating petroleum-based carbon from everyday products while maintaining performance standards.
