The European Union has issued **Commission Regulation (EU) 2025/2269** to correct and clarify labeling requirements for recycled plastics used in food contact applications. Published on November 13, 2025, the regulation entered into force on December 3, 2025, establishing stricter oversight of the recycled plastics supply chain. This amendment addresses critical gaps in existing food safety frameworks as the EU market for recycled plastic materials continues to expand.

## Background

Regulation 2025/2269 refines labeling duties, responsibility for safety reports, confidentiality rules, and authorization transfer procedures for recycled plastic manufacturers and converters. The correction tightens labeling requirements for recycled plastic delivered to converters, ensuring traceability throughout the supply chain. The regulation extends to all recycling processes and requires food business operators to source recycled plastics exclusively from registered facilities that comply with EU standards. Suppliers must provide declarations of compliance according to templates established under the broader Regulation 2022/1616.

## Significance

For the bioplastics and sustainable materials industry, this amendment strengthens market confidence in recycled plastic safety and quality. The establishment of an EU register for recyclers, recycling processes, and installations enables competent authorities to maintain rigorous quality control. Non-EU exporters must ensure their recycling facilities register and comply fully if their products enter the EU market. These enhanced requirements position the EU as a leader in circular economy standards, potentially influencing global recycled plastic regulations while creating competitive advantages for compliant manufacturers and converters operating within the framework.
