The European Commission adopted a new Bioeconomy Strategy on November 27, 2025, in Brussels, to unlock the sector's potential amid Europe's push for sustainability and competitiveness. Building on the 2012 strategy and its 2018 update, it shifts focus from research to industrial deployment, market scale-up, and resilience against fossil fuel dependency, responding to 2023-2024 Council conclusions and the 2024-2029 strategic agenda.

## Background

The strategy rests on **four pillars**: scaling innovation and investment, creating markets for bio-based materials, ensuring sustainable biomass supply, and fostering global partnerships. Key actions include the EU Biotech Act in two phases—first on health and food (December 2025), second on industrial policy (Q3 2026)—to simplify regulations and speed authorizations. From 2026, improved finance access via the Scale-up Europe Fund targets bioeconomy startups, with a Bioeconomy Investment Deployment Group to pipeline projects. Guidance on classifying bio-based products and SME support for advanced fermentation are also planned.

## Significance

For the **bioplastics industry**, this strategy promises transformative impact by stimulating demand for bio-based chemicals and materials through potential content requirements and a European Bio-based Alliance for joint procurement. It accelerates scale-up of industrial biotechnology, reduces regulatory hurdles, and boosts funding via Horizon Europe and InvestEU, fostering cost-competitive alternatives to fossil plastics. With the bioeconomy already worth €2.7 trillion and employing 17 million, these measures enhance circularity, cut emissions, and strengthen EU leadership in sustainable polymers and textiles, aligning with 2030 climate goals.
