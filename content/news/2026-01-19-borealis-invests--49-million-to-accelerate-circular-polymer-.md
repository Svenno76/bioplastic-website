## Strengthening the Burghausen Hub

In a decisive move toward a more sustainable future, Borealis has announced a substantial €49 million investment at its production site in Burghausen, Germany. This capital injection is specifically targeted at enhancing the facility’s ability to design and produce polymers for circularity, reinforcing the company’s commitment to a carbon-neutral and waste-free industry.

The investment will be used to modernize existing infrastructure, focusing on the site's cracker units and downstream processing. By upgrading these facilities, Borealis aims to improve feedstock flexibility, allowing for the integration of more recycled and renewable raw materials into the production process. This shift is a cornerstone of the company’s strategy to phase out traditional fossil-based feedstocks in favor of circular solutions that minimize environmental impact.

## Advancing the "Design for Circularity" Concept

The Burghausen site, already a critical hub for Borealis’ European operations, will now serve as a spearhead for the "Design for Circularity" initiative. This involves creating materials that are not only high-performing but also inherently designed to be easier to recycle at the end of their lifecycle. By closing the loop in the plastics value chain, Borealis is addressing the global plastic waste challenge at its source.

This commitment aligns with Borealis’ broader "EverMinds" ambition, which seeks to accelerate the transition to a circular economy. The upgrades will ensure that the site remains competitive in a shifting market while responding to increasing regulatory pressure and growing consumer demand for sustainable packaging and industrial materials.

## A Benchmark for the Chemical Industry

As the European chemical industry faces unprecedented challenges regarding decarbonization and resource efficiency, Borealis’ proactive approach sets a benchmark for innovation. By focusing on circular design and bio-based alternatives today, the company is securing its position as a leader in the next generation of polymer science. This investment ensures that Burghausen will remain at the forefront of the industry's green transition for years to come.
