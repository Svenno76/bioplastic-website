BASF has expanded its **ecovio® biodegradable mulch film portfolio** in 2025, targeting diverse climate zones across Asia and Latin America to support sustainable agriculture and meet growing demand in high-growth markets. This move aligns with BASF’s commitment to advancing eco-friendly agricultural solutions that reduce plastic pollution and improve soil health. The expansion enhances BASF’s position as a leading supplier of biodegradable polymers for agricultural films, addressing critical environmental and operational challenges faced by farmers worldwide.

## Product Innovation

The expanded ecovio® portfolio features **ecovio® M 2351**, a certified soil-biodegradable mulch film made from BASF’s compostable co-polyester PBAT (ecoflex®) combined with renewable raw materials. These films can be ploughed directly into the soil after harvest, where naturally occurring microorganisms biodegrade the material into CO2, water, and biomass, eliminating the need for film removal and recycling. ecovio® M 2351 offers mechanical properties comparable to conventional polyethylene films while preventing persistent microplastic accumulation in agricultural soils. This innovation supports higher crop yields and faster harvesting processes.

## Applications

BASF’s ecovio® mulch films address key environmental concerns by reducing plastic waste and microplastic contamination in soils, which can harm soil organisms and disrupt nutrient cycles. The product’s adaptability to various climatic conditions makes it suitable for sustainable farming practices in Asia and Latin America, regions experiencing rapid agricultural growth. As regulatory pressures and consumer demand for eco-friendly products increase, BASF’s biodegradable mulch films contribute to the broader bioplastics industry trend toward sustainable, high-performance agricultural inputs that enhance soil health and productivity while supporting circular economy principles.
