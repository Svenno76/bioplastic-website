## Details

AIMPLAS, a leading Plastics Technology Centre, is heading the MICROFAGO project, an innovative initiative designed to accelerate the degradation of compostable bioplastics within existing waste treatment processes. The project aims to integrate specific biotechnological techniques, leveraging the power of microorganisms and natural viruses known as phages, to modulate and enhance biodegradation efficiency. This strategic approach is crucial as global bioplastics production is projected to reach 5.7 million tonnes by 2029, highlighting the urgent need for effective end-of-life solutions.

A key benefit of the MICROFAGO project is its ability to improve biodegradation without necessitating significant modifications to current waste treatment infrastructure. This tackles the challenge of incomplete bioplastic breakdown observed in some existing composting and waste treatment facilities, which can hinder waste recovery and create environmental issues. The collaborative effort involves esteemed partners such as the University of Valencia's Department of Plant Biology, Darwin Bioprospecting Excellence, Evolving Therapeutics, and the waste management company Girsa. Giovanni Gadaleta, an AIMPLAS researcher, emphasized the importance of identifying and ensuring sufficient quantities of the most effective microorganisms for the process. The project is funded by the Valencian Institute of Competitiveness and Innovation (IVACE+i) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).

## Impact

The MICROFAGO project is set to significantly improve the efficiency of bioplastics biodegradation, leading to more effective and sustainable waste treatment practices. By providing a safe and efficient method, the initiative offers practical advantages for waste management companies, enabling them to enhance bioplastics breakdown without substantial capital investment in new facilities. The technology will be rigorously tested across laboratory, pilot, and industrial scales, with results compared against established biodegradation standards. Ultimately, this project strongly supports the principles of a circular economy by facilitating the organic recovery of bioplastic waste.
