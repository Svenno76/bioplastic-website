**Braskem Advances Sustainable Packaging with I'm green Bio-based HDPE and MDO Films**

Braskem, a global leader in biopolymers, has unveiled innovative bio-based solutions designed to accelerate the transition toward circular economy packaging. The company introduced I'm green™ bio-based high-density polyethylene (HDPE) specifically engineered for non-wovens applications, alongside a new Machine Direction-Oriented (MDO) film technology. Both products are derived from responsibly sourced sugarcane ethanol, reinforcing Braskem's commitment to sustainable materials innovation.

## Product Innovation

The new I'm green™ bio-based HDPE for non-wovens delivers exceptional performance characteristics including low gel levels, excellent processing stability, and improved heat and color resistance. According to a 2023 Life Cycle Assessment, the material achieves a carbon footprint of -2.01 kgCO₂e per kg, demonstrating significant environmental benefits. The MDO film variant, developed collaboratively with Cazoolo and FCO Group, offers enhanced stiffness and optical clarity while enabling mono-material packaging solutions such as flow packs and stand-up pouches.

## Applications and Industry Impact

These innovations address critical market demands for sustainable hygiene and packaging solutions. The HDPE performs reliably in both bi-component spunbond and mono-component processes, making it ideal for diapers and other high-performance hygiene applications. The MDO films support circular economy objectives by enabling recyclable, single-material packaging structures that maintain performance requirements. When replacing fossil-based alternatives, the HDPE delivers approximately 5 kg CO₂e net benefits per kilogram, positioning Braskem's portfolio as a commercially viable solution for manufacturers seeking to reduce environmental impact without compromising product quality.
