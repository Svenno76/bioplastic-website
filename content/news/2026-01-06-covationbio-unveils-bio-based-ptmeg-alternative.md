Covation Biomaterials unveiled **bioPTMEG**, a bio-based alternative to petroleum-derived polytetramethylene ether glycol, at Chinaplas 2025 in Shenzhen, China, from April 15-18. The company introduced this sustainable material as a "drop-in" replacement designed to reduce environmental impact without requiring significant manufacturing process changes. Made entirely from renewable resources such as corncobs, bioPTMEG delivers substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-based PTMEG while maintaining performance standards. The launch reflects growing industry demand for sustainable materials that address climate concerns without compromising functionality.

## Product Innovation

CovationBio's bioPTMEG is engineered as a seamless substitute for traditional PTMEG, enabling manufacturers to integrate the bio-based material into existing production systems without extensive product development. The feedstock—non-food biomass like corncobs—does not compete with primary food sources, addressing sustainability concerns. The company is scaling production at a dedicated manufacturing facility in Jiangsu Province, Qidong, with mechanical completion expected by late 2025 and commercial production beginning in the first quarter of 2026.

## Applications and Industry Impact

BioPTMEG targets high-performance applications including spandex, polyurethanes, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and thermoplastic elastomers. By offering equivalent durability and resilience to petroleum-based alternatives, the material enables manufacturers to reduce reliance on non-renewable resources while meeting performance requirements. This innovation positions CovationBio as a key player in the industry's defossilization efforts, supporting customers' sustainability goals and advancing the transition toward a decarbonized materials industry.
