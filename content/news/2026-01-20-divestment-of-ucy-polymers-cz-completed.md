Indorama Ventures Public Company Limited (IVL), a global sustainable chemical company, has officially announced the completion of the divestment of its indirect subsidiary, UCY Polymers CZ s.r.o. The transaction involves the sale of a 100 percent equity stake in the Czech Republic-based facility, marking a deliberate move in the company's ongoing strategy to optimize its global asset portfolio and improve capital efficiency.

## Strategic Portfolio Optimization

The divestment aligns with Indorama Ventures' broader "IVL 2.0" strategic framework, which prioritizes the streamlining of operations and the deleveraging of the business. By divesting the Czech subsidiary, IVL aims to sharpen its focus on core verticals where it holds a competitive advantage, particularly in integrated PET and feedstock markets.

While UCY Polymers CZ has served as a component in the regional recycling infrastructure, IVL’s management has determined that the asset no longer fits the long-term integration requirements of its European operations. This rigorous approach to asset rotation allows the company to reallocate resources toward high-growth areas and sustainability initiatives that offer higher returns on capital employed.

## Continuity in PET Recycling

UCY Polymers CZ is known for its role in the mechanical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The facility processes post-consumer PET flake, converting it into varying grades of recycled material suitable for industrial applications. Despite the change in ownership, the demand for high-quality rPET in Central Europe remains robust, driven by the EU’s Single-Use Plastics Directive and increasing corporate sustainability mandates.

The sale ensures that the facility can operate under a new strategic direction, potentially allowing for more localized adaptation to the Czech market's specific recycling needs. For the wider bioplastics and recycling sector, this transaction signals a period of consolidation where major global producers are fine-tuning their footprints to navigate a complex regulatory and economic landscape.
