Mitsui Chemicals has announced that Lawson, one of Japan’s premier convenience store chains, has selected the "Prasus" series of bio-based polyethylene for use in its product packaging. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the retail sector's efforts to decouple from fossil fuel dependencies while maintaining the rigorous quality standards required for food safety and logistics.

## The Mass-Balance Advantage

The adoption of Prasus relies on a mass-balance approach, a method that is becoming increasingly critical for scaling bioplastics in 2026. In this process, bio-based feedstocks—often derived from waste cooking oils or residue oils—are mixed with petroleum-based feedstocks during the cracking process. The resulting biological value is then allocated to specific products through third-party certification, typically ISCC PLUS.

For a retailer like Lawson, the primary advantage of Mitsui Chemicals' Prasus polyethylene is its status as a "drop-in" solution. Because the chemical structure of the bio-based PE is identical to conventional fossil-based PE, it retains the exact same physical properties, including water resistance, durability, and transparency. This allows Lawson to transition to sustainable materials without modifying existing packaging machinery or compromising the shelf-life of perishable goods.

## Driving Circularity in Retail

This partnership addresses the urgent need to reduce Scope 3 emissions within the retail supply chain. By integrating plant-derived materials, Lawson aims to significantly lower the Green House Gas (GHG) emissions associated with the life cycle of its packaging.

Mitsui Chemicals has been aggressively expanding its lineup of bio-based hydrocarbons under the Prasus brand. The company views this collaboration as a model for how material suppliers and consumer-facing brands can work together to establish a circular economy. As the rollout begins, consumers can expect to see the bio-based packaging applied to various store-brand items, contributing to a reduction in the use of virgin fossil plastics across Lawson’s extensive network of stores.
