askem America, a subsidiary of the world's leading biopolymer producer Braskem S.A., has announced a significant expansion of production capacity for its flagship **I'm green™ bio-based polyethylene (PE)**. This recyclable, sugarcane-derived resin, developed at the company's Triunfo Petrochemical Complex in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, now reaches **275,000 tons per year**—a 37% increase from the original 200,000 tons achieved through a US$61 million investment. The move supports Braskem's mission to drive a circular economy and carbon neutrality by 2050, capturing approximately **159,000 tons of CO₂ annually**, equivalent to the emissions of 12,000 U.S. citizens.

## Facility Details

The expansion builds on milestones from 2021-2023, including a 30% capacity boost at the Triunfo bio-based ethylene plant, surpassing targets to hit 275kt/year via sugarcane ethanol dehydration. Braskem's I'm green™ portfolio, celebrating its 15th anniversary, includes bio-based HDPE, EVA, and polyethylene wax, all fully recyclable and produced at industrial scale. Each ton of I'm green™ HDPE avoids about **3.09-5 tons of CO₂ equivalent** compared to fossil-based alternatives, with bio-based content verified by ASTM D6866 standards. A new joint venture, Braskem Siam with SCG Chemicals in Thailand, further scales bio-ethylene production using EtE EverGreen™ technology.

## Market Impact

This expansion positions Braskem to meet surging demand for sustainable materials, serving over 200 global brands in packaging, footwear, consumer goods, and more—such as Balsam Hill's plant-based Christmas trees. By 2025, Braskem aims for 300,000 tons of recycled content sales, accelerating the bioplastics shift toward renewables amid regulatory pressures for lower emissions. Partnerships like with FKuR for European distribution enhance accessibility, fostering innovation in low-carbon plastics and circular supply chains across the Americas, Europe, and Asia.
