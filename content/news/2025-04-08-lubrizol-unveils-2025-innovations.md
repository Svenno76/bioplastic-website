Lubrizol, a global specialty chemistry leader, has unveiled a portfolio of sustainable polymer innovations designed to meet the beauty industry's growing demand for environmentally responsible solutions. The company's 2025 product launches represent a significant shift toward biodegradable alternatives that maintain high performance standards. These innovations address consumer preferences for natural, eco-conscious personal care products while supporting regulatory requirements for reduced environmental impact.

## Product Innovation

The flagship offering is **Carbopol® BioSense polymer**, the first readily biodegradable ingredient in Lubrizol's Carbopol® line, developed through a partnership with Suzano, the world's largest cellulose pulp producer. With over 98% natural origin content and COSMOS/ECOCERT certification, this modified cellulose gum delivers exceptional sensory performance comparable to silicone elastomers without oily residue. Additionally, **Sensomer™ Cassia 115 polymer** offers naturally derived, biodegradable conditioning properties ideal for hair care applications, featuring foam-boosting and film-forming capabilities.

## Applications

These innovations enable formulators to create serums, creams, lotions, and sun protection products that align with sustainability principles while maintaining premium performance. Carbopol® BioSense polymer's ability to replace synthetic silicone elastomers represents a breakthrough for the natural beauty segment, addressing the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry. The polymers' versatility across skincare, sun care, and hair care applications positions them as transformative solutions for manufacturers seeking to reduce environmental impact without compromising product efficacy or consumer experience.
