## Details of the Partnership and Product Launch

CJ Biomaterials, a leading producer of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers, has partnered with NatureWorks, a prominent manufacturer of Ingeo™ polylactic acid (PLA) biopolymer, to introduce two innovative PHA-based compounds: PHACT™ CA1270P and PHACT™ CA1240PF. These novel materials are designed to serve as compostable alternatives for flexible packaging applications, addressing the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the packaging industry. The collaboration stems from a Master Collaboration Agreement signed in November 2022, aimed at developing advanced biopolymer solutions.

The newly developed compounds, PHACT™ CA1270P (clear) and PHACT™ CA1240PF (opaque), integrate NatureWorks’ Ingeo™ PLA with CJ Biomaterials' amorphous PHA (aPHA) biopolymers. This unique combination is engineered for use in blown, cast, and machine direction orientation (MDO) film applications. These 100% biobased compounds are set to replace traditional plastic films, offering a significantly lower carbon footprint, more than 50% less than conventional solutions like LDPE/PE/PP/PET.

## Impact and Applications

The PHACT™ CA1270P and CA1240PF compounds bring substantial performance enhancements, including improved flexibility, impact toughening, and tear propagation resistance compared to films made solely from PLA. They also demonstrate superior sealability and reduced noise during handling. These characteristics make them ideal for a broad range of flexible packaging needs, such as snack food and produce packaging, frozen food bags, shopping bags, shrink-wrap, labels, hygiene backing films, organic waste diversion bags, and agricultural mulch films.

Both compounds are industrially compostable, with PHACT™ CA1240PF currently undergoing testing for home compostability, further aligning with consumer preferences for environmentally friendly disposal options. The introduction of these compounds marks a significant step in diverting food waste from landfills, thereby reducing methane emissions and supporting a circular economy.
