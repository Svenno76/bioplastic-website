## Details

Braskem, a global leader in polymers and biopolymers, and Norsk e-Fuel, a pioneer in Power-to-Liquid (PtL) technology, announced a strategic collaboration on December 6, 2023. This partnership aims to integrate e-Naphtha, produced from fossil-free electricity, water, and captured carbon dioxide (CO2), into the plastics value chain. The initiative is designed to accelerate the development of plastics derived from carbon that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, promoting a circular economy and reducing the plastics industry's carbon footprint.

Norsk e-Fuel is committed to scaling up PtL technology, with plans to operate at least three industrial plants by 2032. These facilities are projected to produce over 200,000 tons of sustainable e-fuels and feedstocks annually, with approximately a quarter of this output potentially supplied as e-Naphtha. Braskem intends to process this versatile e-Naphtha into essential materials like polypropylene, expanding its portfolio with innovative plastics that boast a significantly reduced climate footprint.

## Impact

This collaboration underscores both companies' dedication to sustainability and circularity. Braskem's "Keeping Carbon in the Loop" strategy focuses on retaining carbon within products and the economy through renewable and carbon-optimized solutions. The partnership will focus on establishing a framework for integrating e-Naphtha into plastic production, assessing market opportunities, and engaging customers who seek circular solutions. According to Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO of Norsk e-Fuel, e-Naphtha is crucial for creating long-lasting, circular products by embedding captured carbon into durable, recyclable materials. Walmir Soller, Vice President at Braskem, emphasized that producing plastics with captured carbon keeps it in the economy, rather than in the air. This partnership highlights the potential of carbon capture utilization (CCU) to forge new value chains within the plastics industry.
