Braskem, a global leader in polymers and biopolymers, has partnered with Norsk e-Fuel, a pioneer in Power-to-Liquid (PtL) technology, to integrate e-Naphtha—produced from fossil-free electricity, water, and captured CO₂—into the plastics value chain. Announced recently, this strategic collaboration aims to create long-lasting, recyclable plastics from carbon that would otherwise enter the atmosphere, aligning with both companies' circular economy goals. Norsk e-Fuel, founded in 2019 to advance sustainable aviation fuels, plans three industrial plants by 2032.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership focuses on developing a framework for incorporating e-Naphtha, a versatile feedstock, into Braskem's production of polypropylene and other plastics. Norsk e-Fuel's facilities will produce over 200,000 tons of synthetic fuels annually, with about 25% as e-Naphtha—potentially 50,000 tons. "e-Naphtha is more than a by-product; it’s a key to building long-lasting, circular products," said Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO of Norsk e-Fuel. Braskem's VP Walmir Soller added, "By producing plastics with captured carbon, we keep that carbon in the economy—not in the air." Efforts include mapping market opportunities and customer engagement for circular solutions.

## Expected Outcomes

This initiative reinforces Braskem's "Keeping Carbon in the Loop" strategy, which already includes scaled bio-based polyethylene and mass-balance certified plastics, targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. For the bioplastics industry, it pioneers carbon capture utilization (CCU), slashing climate footprints while enabling durable, recyclable materials. By embedding CO₂ in products, the partnership creates new value chains, accelerates PtL scaling, and supports global decarbonization without relying on food-competing biofuels.
