## A Strategic Expansion in Western Canada

Polykar, a leading Canadian manufacturer of sustainable packaging solutions, has officially announced a massive $20 million investment to double the production capacity of its state-of-the-art facility in Edmonton, Alberta. This expansion marks a significant milestone for the company, which originally opened the 50,000-square-foot plant to serve as its primary hub for the Western Canadian and U.S. markets. 

The decision to scale up comes in response to an unprecedented surge in demand for eco-friendly packaging and high-performance polyethylene films. By doubling its footprint and machinery, Polykar aims to solidify its position as a frontrunner in the transition toward a circular economy.

## Scaling Up for a Greener Future

The new investment will integrate cutting-edge extrusion and converting technologies, allowing the facility to produce a wider range of sustainable products. This includes the company's signature certified compostable bags and high-performance commercial packaging. A primary focus of the expanded operations will be the increased production of recycled resins, which are essential for reducing the carbon footprint of modern plastic products.

“This expansion is not just about growth; it is about responding to the urgent need for sustainable manufacturing at scale,” the company stated. The Edmonton site is already recognized as one of the most advanced of its kind in North America, and the new capacity will allow Polykar to divert even more plastic waste from landfills by re-integrating it into the supply chain.

## Driving Regional Economic Growth

Beyond the environmental benefits, the $20 million expansion is a major win for the Alberta economy. The project is expected to create dozens of high-skilled manufacturing jobs, adding to the company’s existing workforce in the region. By choosing Edmonton as the site for this expansion, Polykar is leveraging the city's strategic logistics network and its growing reputation as a hub for industrial innovation.

As global regulations tighten around single-use plastics, Polykar’s investment ensures that North American businesses have access to locally produced, sustainable alternatives that do not compromise on quality or durability.
