Blue Ocean Closures (BOC), a Swedish pioneer in fiber-based packaging, has announced a major breakthrough: its latest fiber screw caps now match or outperform fossil plastics in material costs while using far less energy in production. This milestone, achieved through years of R&D and collaborations with brands like Great Earth and The Absolut Group, positions sustainable closures as commercially viable amid EU regulations pushing circular packaging.

## Product Innovation

BOC's proprietary vacuum press forming technology shapes renewable fibers from virgin or recycled carton board feedstock into high-speed screw caps, with production cycles under two seconds and energy use one-tenth that of plastic molding. CEO Lars Sandberg highlighted, “For the first time, fiber-based closures are cost-competitive or cheaper than fossil plastics, while consuming significantly less energy.” The caps integrate seamlessly with existing recycling systems and filling lines, offering drop-in compatibility without machinery changes.

## Applications

This innovation accelerates the bioplastics shift by replacing plastic in nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and beverages, reducing ocean plastic pollution—where caps rank among top marine debris—and cutting carbon footprints. Great Earth, an early adopter, swapped all supplement jars to BOC's NutraCap 38-400, slashing plastic use by 2.6 tons annually while maintaining seal integrity and shelf appeal. With customizable designs enhancing brand differentiation, BOC's caps support 90% fiber recycling goals by 2030, aligning profitability with sustainability demands.
