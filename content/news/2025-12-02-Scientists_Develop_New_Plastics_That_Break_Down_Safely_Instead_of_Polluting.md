## Details
Rutgers University scientists, spearheaded by Assistant Professor Yuwei Gu, have developed a groundbreaking class of plastics designed to degrade naturally in everyday environments, addressing the pervasive issue of plastic pollution. The research, published in *Nature Chemistry*, introduces a method to create plastics that break down without the need for industrial composting facilities or harsh chemical treatments.

The inspiration for this innovation struck Dr. Gu during a hike, where the sight of plastic litter prompted him to ponder why natural polymers like DNA and RNA degrade, while synthetic plastics persist for centuries. The team's breakthrough lies in mimicking nature's blueprint by embedding "helper groups" into the molecular structure of synthetic polymers. These groups are strategically positioned to weaken chemical bonds, enabling the plastic to break down when triggered.

## Innovation and Impact
Unlike conventional plastics that rely on strong, stable bonds, the newly engineered materials can be programmed to degrade at specific rates—from days to years—by controlling the spatial arrangement of these internal "trigger" points. This programmable degradation can also be activated or deactivated using environmental cues like ultraviolet light or metal ions, providing unprecedented control over the material's lifespan.

This discovery holds significant promise for a variety of applications beyond tackling plastic waste, including timed drug-release capsules, self-erasing coatings, and more sustainable agricultural plastics. Early lab tests indicate that the liquid produced during the degradation process is non-toxic, though further research is underway to ensure environmental safety and to explore the adaptability of this method to existing manufacturing processes. The ultimate goal for Dr. Gu and his team is to create plastics that serve their purpose efficiently and then safely disappear, contributing to a more sustainable future.
