enzing Group, a leading Austrian producer of regenerated cellulosic fibers, has partnered with Swiss innovator OceanSafe to launch a next-generation yarn blending **TENCEL™ Lyocell A100** fibers with **naNea** co-polyester. Announced on October 28, 2025, in Lenzing, Austria, this collaboration addresses the textile industry's demand for sustainable, high-performance materials that reduce environmental impact while delivering durability and functionality.

## Product Innovation

The yarn synergizes Lenzing’s wood-based **TENCEL™ Lyocell A100**, produced via a closed-loop process with over 99.8% solvent recovery, ≥50% lower carbon emissions and water use than generic lyocell, and sourced from FSC®-certified wood. It pairs with OceanSafe’s **naNea**, a proprietary co-polyester from recycled, bio-based, or virgin feedstocks that biodegrades >93% in ocean water within 99 days per ASTM D6691-17, achieving Cradle to Cradle Certified® Gold status. The result offers softness, moisture management, odor resistance, tear strength, and quick-drying properties superior to conventional polyester.

## Applications

This innovation sets a benchmark for the **bioplastics and sustainable materials sector** by providing a circular alternative to petroleum-based synthetics, curbing microplastic pollution in marine environments. A capsule collection with Impetus showcases yoga wear, athleisure T-shirts, and fleece jackets, with potential expansion to footwear, home textiles, bags, and technical products. Backed by partners like Tearfil and Kingwhale, it accelerates industry adoption of biodegradable performance textiles balancing ecology and performance.
