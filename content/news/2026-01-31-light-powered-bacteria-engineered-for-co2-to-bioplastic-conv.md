## Harnessing Photosynthesis for Polymer Production

In a significant advancement for the bioplastics sector, researchers reported by GeneOnline have successfully engineered a strain of bacteria capable of converting carbon dioxide (CO2) directly into biodegradable plastics and biofuels using only light energy. This breakthrough represents a major leap in synthetic biology, offering a potential alternative to fossil-fuel-derived polymers and land-intensive crop-based bioplastics.

The study focuses on modifying *Rhodopseudomonas palustris*, a purple non-sulfur bacterium known for its metabolic versatility. By rewiring the organism's metabolic pathways, the research team enabled the bacteria to function as a "biological factory," capturing atmospheric carbon and synthesizing it into polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), a type of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) that is fully biodegradable and marine-compostable.

## The Mechanics of Microbial Manufacturing

Unlike traditional bioplastic production, which often relies on sugar feedstocks derived from corn or sugarcane, this new method utilizes a "carbon-negative" approach. The engineered bacteria utilize a process similar to photosynthesis. They harvest electrons from light and use that energy to fix CO2. However, instead of producing glucose to grow, the engineered strain shunts the carbon into intracellular granules of PHB.

According to the technical data released, the conversion efficiency has reached levels viable for pilot-scale testing. The bacteria produced n-butanol and PHB with significantly higher yields than wild-type strains. This suggests that the technology could eventually be integrated into industrial photobioreactors, where waste CO2 from industrial emitters is fed directly to the bacterial colonies.

## Implications for a Circular Economy

The scalability of this technology could address two critical environmental challenges simultaneously: the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the accumulation of persistent plastic waste. As the material produced is a naturally occurring polyester, it offers material properties similar to polypropylene but decomposes rapidly in natural environments.

This development marks a pivot point for the industry, moving away from "carbon-neutral" materials toward "carbon-negative" manufacturing, where the production process itself acts as a carbon sink.
