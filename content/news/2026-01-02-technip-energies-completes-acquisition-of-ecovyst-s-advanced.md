PARIS – Marking a significant milestone in its transition toward sustainable industrial solutions, Technip Energies (PARIS: TE) officially announced today the completion of its acquisition of Ecovyst’s Advanced Materials & Catalysts (AMC) business. The deal, finalized on January 2, 2026, positions Technip Energies as a formidable leader in the development of high-performance catalysts essential for the bioplastics and circular economy sectors.

The acquisition integrates Ecovyst’s specialty silica and catalyst technologies into Technip Energies’ burgeoning technology portfolio. This move is more than a simple expansion; it represents a vertical integration strategy aimed at shortening the development cycle for bio-based chemical processes. By owning the proprietary catalyst technology used in the conversion of renewable feedstocks, Technip Energies can now offer end-to-end solutions for companies looking to replace petroleum-based plastics with sustainable alternatives.

## Accelerating the Circular Economy

As global demand for sustainable packaging and bio-based polymers continues to surge, the role of specialized catalysts has become paramount. These materials act as the "hidden engines" of the bioplastic industry, enabling the efficient transformation of ethanol, sugars, or waste oils into the building blocks for polymers like PLA (polylactic acid) and PEF (polyethylene furanoate). 

"This acquisition is a cornerstone of our strategy to accelerate the energy transition," said a spokesperson for Technip Energies. "By combining our engineering prowess with Ecovyst’s advanced materials expertise, we are uniquely positioned to unlock the full potential of green chemistry and provide our clients with the tools necessary to meet their decarbonization goals."

## A New Era for Bioplastic Production

The integration of the AMC business is expected to drive significant R&D synergies. Industry analysts predict that Technip Energies will leverage this new portfolio to refine its proprietary bioplastic production licenses, potentially lowering the cost of entry for new market players. This deal signals a shift in the industrial landscape, where engineering firms are increasingly becoming material science innovators to meet the world’s urgent need for high-performance, planet-friendly materials.
