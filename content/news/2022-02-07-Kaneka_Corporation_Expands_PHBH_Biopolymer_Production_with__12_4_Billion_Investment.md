Kaneka Corporation, a prominent bioplastic producer, announced a significant investment of ¥12.4 billion in October 2025 to expand its production of PHBH biopolymer, marketed as Green Planet™. This strategic capital injection aims to meet the escalating domestic demand in Japan for compostable packaging and cutlery, simultaneously enhancing the versatility and stability of its supply chain. This move is poised to strengthen Kaneka's leading position within Japan's burgeoning biodegradable plastics sector.

## Details of the Investment and PHBH Biopolymer

The ¥12.4 billion investment, made in October 2025, underscores Kaneka's commitment to sustainable solutions in response to a global push for eco-friendly alternatives to conventional plastics. Kaneka's PHBH, or poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate), is a unique PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoate) biopolymer produced through a microorganism biosynthesis process, utilizing plant oils as primary raw materials. A key characteristic of PHBH is its proven biodegradability in diverse natural environments, including soil and seawater, where it eventually decomposes into CO2 and water. This feature makes it an attractive material for applications where plastic waste accumulation is a significant concern, such as single-use items.

PHBH is already extensively utilized in various applications, including straws, shopping bags, cutlery, coffee capsules, and food packaging films. The material's ability to be processed using standard plastic equipment further contributes to its appeal and potential for widespread adoption. Kaneka's Green Planet™ has also obtained "OK Biodegradable Marine" certification for certain grades, highlighting its environmental benefits.

## Impact and Market Outlook

This latest expansion follows previous efforts by Kaneka to scale up its PHBH production. Earlier reports indicated plans to increase capacity at its Takasago manufacturing site from 5,000 tons/year to 20,000 tons/year by January 2024, involving an investment of approximately ¥15 billion. The October 2025 investment signifies a continued and substantial commitment to further expanding this crucial biopolymer's availability. By boosting production, Kaneka aims to cater to the increasing demand driven by consumer environmental awareness and regulatory changes, such as Japan's Act on Resource Circulation for Plastics, which mandates a reduction in single-use plastics. The company projects a significant global business potential for PHBH, seeing it as a core product capable of replacing millions of tons of traditional single-use plastics annually.
