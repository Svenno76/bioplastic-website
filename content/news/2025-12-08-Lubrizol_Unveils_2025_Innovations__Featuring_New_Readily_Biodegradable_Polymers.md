Lubrizol, a leading specialty chemical company, announced significant innovations for 2025, prominently featuring the introduction of new readily biodegradable polymers designed to advance sustainable chemistry. These developments align with Lubrizol's long-standing commitment to enhancing life, delivering local solutions, and accelerating progress through science-based innovations.

## Details

Among the key product launches are Carbopol® BioSense Polymer and Sensomer™ Cassia 115 Polymer. Carbopol® BioSense Polymer is a readily biodegradable rheology modifier and sensory enhancer, responsibly sourced from eucalyptus. It is specifically formulated for personal care products, delivering outstanding performance that mimics the luxurious feel of silicone elastomers while upholding strong sustainability credentials. This polymer boasts a 98% natural origin content and is certified by COSMOS/ECOCERT, alongside being readily biodegradable (OECD 301D). It enhances viscosity and provides a rich, soft, non-sticky sensory experience.

Complementing this, Sensomer™ Cassia 115 Polymer is a naturally derived, biodegradable conditioning polymer sourced from the cassia plant. It offers excellent sensory properties, deposition profiles, and foam-boosting capabilities, making it ideal for both rinse-off and leave-on hair and skin care applications. This vegan-suitable, non-GMO ingredient demonstrates superior cationic and silicone deposition, outperforming many traditional benchmarks. It is also inherently biodegradable (OECD 301B) and microbiome-friendly.

## Impact

These new polymers underscore Lubrizol's strategic focus on sustainable solutions, responding to the growing market demand for environmentally responsible ingredients in consumer products. By providing high-performance, naturally derived, and biodegradable alternatives, Lubrizol is empowering industries to develop more sustainable formulations without compromising on product quality or consumer experience. The launch reflects Lubrizol's century-long legacy of innovation, driven by strategic research and market insights to address global challenges.
