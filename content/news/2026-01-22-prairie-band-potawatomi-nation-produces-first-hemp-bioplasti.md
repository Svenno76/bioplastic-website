The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation has successfully manufactured its first run of hemp-based bioplastics, marking a major milestone in the tribe's initiative to establish a vertically integrated industrial hemp economy. Through its agricultural subsidiary, Prairie Band Ag, the Nation is now converting crops grown on tribal lands in Kansas into finished sustainable goods, moving beyond cultivation into advanced processing and manufacturing.

## Vertical Integration in Kansas

Located north of Topeka, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation has spent years developing the infrastructure required to process industrial hemp. The successful production of bioplastics validates the tribe's strategy to control the entire value chain—from seed to shelf. By keeping the manufacturing process local, Prairie Band Ag is securing economic sovereignty and creating technical jobs within the reservation, while simultaneously reducing the carbon footprint associated with transporting raw biomass to off-site processors.

## Technical Utilization of Hemp Biomass

The production facility utilizes a comprehensive fractionation process to maximize the value of the hemp stalk. The high-cellulose content of the hemp fiber is extracted and processed to create biodegradable polymers capable of replacing traditional petroleum-based plastics in packaging and injection molding applications. 

Simultaneously, the woody core of the plant, known as the hurd, is being diverted for use in construction materials. Specifically, the tribe is utilizing this byproduct to produce hempcrete, a carbon-sequestering building material that provides high thermal insulation. This dual-stream processing ensures that the crop achieves near-zero waste efficiency.

## Building a Sustainable Future

Tribal leadership views this development as a critical step toward environmental and economic self-sufficiency. By producing both bioplastics and sustainable housing materials, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation is addressing two global crises—plastic pollution and sustainable housing—using indigenous agricultural practices adapted for modern industrial applications. The launch positions Prairie Band Ag as a burgeoning leader in the Midwestern bioeconomy.
