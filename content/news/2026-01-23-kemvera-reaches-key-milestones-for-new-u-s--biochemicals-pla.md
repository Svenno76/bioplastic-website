Kemvera, the sustainable chemistry company formerly known as New Iridium, has announced significant progress toward the construction of its first commercial-scale manufacturing facility in the United States. The company has reached critical technical and engineering milestones necessary to deploy its proprietary technology for producing low-carbon biochemicals.

## Advancing Commercial-Scale Production

The upcoming facility will focus on the production of bio-acetic acid and bio-ethyl acetate. These chemicals are essential building blocks and solvents used extensively in the manufacturing of paints, coatings, adhesives, and packaging materials. Historically, these inputs have been derived from fossil fuels with a high carbon footprint.

Kemvera’s recent milestones validate the scalability of their process, moving the company from pilot-stage development into industrial execution. The successful completion of these engineering phases confirms the economic and technical viability of the plant design, positioning the company to secure final site agreements and move toward construction.

## Light-Driven Chemical Manufacturing

At the core of Kemvera’s operations is a groundbreaking photocatalytic platform. Unlike traditional thermochemical processes that rely on high heat and extreme pressure—consuming vast amounts of energy—Kemvera’s technology mimics photosynthesis. By using light activation to drive chemical reactions, the process operates at lower temperatures and pressures.

This method allows for the conversion of bio-based feedstocks and carbon dioxide into high-value chemicals with a significantly reduced carbon intensity.

## Strengthening the U.S. Bio-Economy

The establishment of this U.S. plant represents a strategic move to domesticate the supply chain for green chemicals. By offering drop-in replacements for petrochemical incumbents, Kemvera aims to help downstream manufacturers reduce their Scope 3 emissions without altering their existing formulations or sacrificing performance.
