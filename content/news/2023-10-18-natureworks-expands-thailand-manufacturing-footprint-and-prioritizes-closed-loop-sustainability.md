NatureWorks is accelerating construction on its new fully integrated Ingeo™ PLA biopolymer facility at the Nakhon Sawan Biocomplex (NBC) in Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand, with production and start-up activities now projected for 2025. The leading biopolymer producer, jointly owned by Cargill and PTT Global Chemical, is investing over $600 million to expand its global footprint and meet surging demand for low-carbon, renewably sourced materials, emphasizing closed-loop sustainability through local sugarcane feedstock and efficient process integration.

## Background

The 75,000-ton-per-year facility marks the world's first fully integrated PLA complex, encompassing lactic acid fermentation, lactide monomer production, and polymerization under one operation for enhanced efficiency. Key milestones include Thailand Board of Investment approval in 2021, final authorization from parent companies in 2021, front-end engineering by Jacobs, and recent financing from Krungthai Bank. Construction, initiated in 2022, remains on track despite timeline shifts from an initial 2024 target, supporting NatureWorks' parallel expansion at its Blair, Nebraska plant.

## Significance

This expansion bolsters the bioplastics industry's shift toward scalable, bio-based alternatives, addressing Asia-Pacific demand in 3D printing, hygiene nonwovens, compostable packaging, coffee capsules, tea bags, and food serviceware. By sourcing sugarcane locally within 50 km and prioritizing safety and energy integration, it advances Thailand's bioeconomy under the BCG model while reducing carbon footprints versus oil-based plastics. NatureWorks' move positions it as a global leader, enabling high-performance, compostable solutions and fostering closed-loop systems critical for sustainable materials growth.
