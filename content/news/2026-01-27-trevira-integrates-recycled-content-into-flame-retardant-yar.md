Indorama Ventures Public Company Limited (IVL) has marked a significant milestone in the technical textile sector by integrating recycled content into its renowned Trevira brand flame-retardant yarns. The move addresses a longstanding challenge in the industry: combining the stringent safety requirements of contract textiles with the growing demand for circular economy solutions.

## Advancing Circularity in Technical Textiles

The new product line extends the Trevira CS brand, known globally for permanently flame-retardant polyester fibers. Traditionally, incorporating recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) into high-performance safety textiles has been difficult due to impurity issues that can affect flammability ratings and fiber strength. 

By utilizing advanced chemical recycling technologies, Indorama Ventures has successfully depolymerized post-consumer PET waste back to its monomers. This process allows the company to reintroduce the flame-retardant comonomer during the polymerization phase, ensuring the safety properties are embedded at the molecular level rather than applied as a topical finish.

## Uncompromised Safety and Performance

According to the company, the new eco-friendly variants maintain the identical high-performance standards of virgin Trevira CS. The yarns meet international fire safety standards, including DIN 4102 class B1 and the IMO regulations for maritime use. This development ensures that architects, designers, and contract furnishers in the hospitality and healthcare sectors do not have to choose between sustainability and compliance.

The integration allows for the yarns to be certified under various sustainability labels while retaining the "permanent" flame retardant designation, as the property does not wash out or diminish with wear.

## Strategic Alignment with Sustainability Goals

This launch aligns with Indorama Ventures' broader "Vision 2030" strategy, which aims to increase the company's recycling capacity significantly. By bringing a circular solution to the niche but high-volume market of safety textiles, IVL creates a closed-loop opportunity where end-of-life flame-retardant fabrics can potentially be recycled back into new high-quality fibers, further reducing the carbon footprint of the textile industry.
