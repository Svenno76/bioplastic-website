BioBTX, a pioneering technology company based in the Netherlands, has announced securing over €80 million in funding to realize its first commercial-scale plant for producing renewable aromatics. This substantial investment will fund the construction of the PETRA Circular Chemicals Plant in Delfzijl, set to be the world's inaugural facility to produce sustainable aromatics (BTX) from mixed plastic waste and biomass using BioBTX's innovative Integrated Cascading Catalytic Pyrolysis (ICCP) Technology.

## Details of the Investment and Facility

The funding round for this groundbreaking project totals over €80 million. It includes €42 million in equity from new shareholders such as Invest-NL, Infinity Recycling, and Covestro, alongside continued support from existing investors like Carduso Capital, NOM, and Groninger Groeifonds. Additionally, the financing package features €15 million in debt from the Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund, €4 million from the Province of Groningen, and a €14 million grant from the Dutch Government via RVO, with Invest-NL's contribution partly backed by the European Commission's InvestEU program.

The PETRA plant is designed to convert 20,000 tons of mixed plastic waste annually into high-value renewable aromatics, including benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). These aromatics are crucial chemical building blocks used in the production of various everyday items such as insulating foams, coatings, PET bottles, batteries, and pharmaceuticals. The ICCP technology is capable of processing a wide variety of waste streams, including post-consumer plastic waste and different types of biomass like crude glycerin, sawdust, woodchips, and lignin, providing a sustainable alternative to fossil-based resources.

## Impact on the Circular Economy

This significant investment positions BioBTX at the forefront of the transition towards a circular chemical industry. By converting low-value plastic waste and biomass into essential chemical building blocks, the company aims to significantly reduce carbon emissions and decrease reliance on virgin fossil resources. BioBTX’s mission is to make circular chemistry possible by developing technologies that contribute to a more sustainable future. Once the production process is proven at a commercial scale, BioBTX plans to roll out its technology to chemical industry customers worldwide, furthering its global impact. Niels Schenk, identified as the CTO and Director of Research & Development at BioBTX, plays a key role in the technological advancements and strategic direction of the company.
