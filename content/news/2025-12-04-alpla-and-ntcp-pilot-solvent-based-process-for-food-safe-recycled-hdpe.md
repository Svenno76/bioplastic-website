Austrian packaging specialist **ALPLA** and independent technology institute **NTCP** have launched a groundbreaking four-year pilot project in Heerenveen, Netherlands, to develop the first certified process for producing food-grade recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Funded by the Dutch Ministry of Climate Policy and Green Growth, the initiative employs a patented solvent-based technology to clean and process post-consumer HDPE waste, positioning the companies to meet upcoming EU regulatory requirements.

## Background

The pilot plant began operations following successful laboratory phases, with intensive testing of all process steps now underway. ALPLA has established a dedicated recycling company in the Netherlands to support both the demonstration phase and potential commercial deployment. The solvent-based process represents a significant technological advancement, as no certified EU process currently exists for producing food-grade recycled HDPE material. Michael Heyde, ALPLA's recycling division technology head, described the innovation as "a real game changer" for the industry.

## Significance

The project directly addresses the EU's **Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR)**, which mandates minimum recycled content in packaging from 2030 onward. Success would enable ALPLA to supply high-quality recycled HDPE for food packaging in the fast-moving consumer goods sector at industrial scale. The initiative aligns with ALPLA's broader expansion plans—the company aims to double its recycling capacity to 700,000 tonnes annually by 2030. By closing the plastics value chain and reducing waste volumes, this collaboration demonstrates how advanced recycling technologies can support Europe's circular economy objectives while meeting stringent food-safety standards.
