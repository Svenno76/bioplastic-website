## Details
ALPLA, a leading international packaging and recycling specialist, in collaboration with the National Test Centre Circular Plastics (NTCP), has commenced a four-year pilot project in Heerenveen, Netherlands, to develop and scale a patented solvent-based process for producing food-safe recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE). This innovative project is financially supported by the Dutch Ministry of Climate Policy and Green Growth. The initiative aims to provide a future-proof, affordable, and sustainable solution for plastic food packaging, with plans to scale the technology to industrial production by 2030, coinciding with the implementation of the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). ALPLA has established a new recycling company in the Netherlands specifically for this purpose.

The patented technology, following several years of successful laboratory research and development, is now undergoing intensive testing of all process steps at the NTCP site. A crucial objective is to secure approval from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the near future, as currently there is no certified process in the EU for the production of food-grade HDPE recycled material.

## Impact
This project represents a significant milestone for the circular economy, particularly in the plastics sector. Michael Heyde, Head of Technology Recycling Division at ALPLA, highlighted the potential of their highly efficient technology for cleaning and processing post-consumer recycled material as a "game changer" for the industry. By enabling the production of food-safe rHDPE on an industrial scale, the initiative directly addresses the growing demand for recycled content in packaging and facilitates compliance with upcoming EU regulations. ALPLA already operates 14 recycling facilities globally, with a projected output capacity of 400,000 tonnes of rPET and rHDPE annually, much of which is used in its own packaging production. Martine Brandsma, CEO of NTCP, emphasized that this cooperation aligns perfectly with NTCP's mission to accelerate technology developments needed to close the plastics value chain and reduce waste. The industrialization of this technology is expected to make readily available food packaging made from rHDPE for the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) market.
