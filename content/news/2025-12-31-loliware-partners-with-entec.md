**Seaweed-Based Biopolymer Pioneer Loliware Secures Major Distribution Partnership with Entec**

Loliware, a leading innovator in seaweed-based biomaterials, announced an exclusive distribution partnership with Entec Polymers, the world's foremost plastic resin distributor, in May 2025. The strategic collaboration marks a significant milestone in accelerating the global transition to regenerative, certified compostable materials. Under the agreement, Entec will distribute Loliware's proprietary Sea Technology® resins through its extensive global network, making these innovative biopolymers accessible to manufacturers worldwide.

## Collaboration Details

Entec conducted a rigorous year-long evaluation of Loliware's resins before finalizing the partnership, assessing their processing efficiency, performance, sustainability, and regulatory compliance. The Sea Technology® resins are engineered as high-performance, drop-in biopolymers compatible with existing plastic manufacturing infrastructure, suitable for extrusion and injection molding applications. Founded in 2016, Loliware formulates next-generation seaweed-based alternatives to single-use plastics, with resins that rival conventional plastic performance while eliminating microplastic pollution.

## Expected Outcomes

The partnership positions both companies to capitalize on the rapidly expanding biopolymer market, projected to grow at a 10.4% compound annual growth rate from 2024 to 2030, reaching $52.33 billion by 2034. By incorporating Loliware's bioresins into its portfolio, Entec can help customers meet increasing consumer demand for sustainable materials while adapting to evolving regulations on plastics and microplastics. Loliware CEO Sea Briganti described the partnership as pivotal for the company's mission to "regenerate the materials industry" by making their technology more widely accessible and accelerating innovation at scale.
