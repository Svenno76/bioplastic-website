Novamont, a global leader in bioplastics and biochemicals, announced on November 6, 2025, that its Mater-Bi mulch film has obtained certification of conformity with the EU Fertilizer Regulation 2019/1009. This certification officially recognizes Mater-Bi as an inorganic soil improver, enabling its use in agricultural applications such as weed control. The certification marks a significant step for Novamont in expanding the practical and sustainable applications of its bioplastic products within the European agricultural sector.

## Certification Details

The EU Fertilizer Regulation 2019/1009 certification confirms that Mater-Bi mulch film is biodegradable in soil and does not require separate disposal. It fully mineralizes through microbial activity into carbon dioxide and water, leaving no microplastics or ecotoxic residues. This compliance aligns with the Delegated Act 2024/2787, which sets strict criteria for biodegradability and environmental safety of polymers used in agriculture. The certification classifies Mater-Bi mulch film as an inorganic soil improver, supporting soil health without contaminating the environment.

## Market Significance

This certification is a milestone for the bioplastics industry, particularly in agriculture, where plastic waste is a growing concern. With global agricultural plastic use exceeding 12.5 million tonnes annually—20% of which is mulch film—biodegradable alternatives like Mater-Bi offer a sustainable solution to reduce soil contamination and microplastic pollution. Novamont’s achievement supports regulatory efforts to promote circular bioeconomy practices and enhances market opportunities for biodegradable agricultural films amid increasing environmental regulations and demand for sustainable farming inputs.
