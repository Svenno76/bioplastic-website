## A Strategic Move for Bio-Based Materials

In a significant move to consolidate its position within the renewable chemicals sector, Primient has announced the successful acquisition of full ownership of the Primient Covation joint venture. By transitioning from a partner to the sole owner, Primient is signaling a long-term commitment to scaling high-performance, plant-based solutions that serve as critical building blocks for the bioplastics and textile industries.

The venture was previously a collaboration focused on the production of Susterra® propanediol (PDO), a 100% plant-based ingredient used to create everything from polyurethane coatings and resins to high-performance outdoor gear. With full control of the entity, Primient aims to streamline its operations and accelerate its innovation pipeline, ensuring that bio-based alternatives can compete more effectively with traditional petroleum-derived products.

## Driving Innovation in Sustainable Chemistry

The acquisition comes at a time when global demand for sustainable materials is reaching an inflection point. As brands across the automotive, apparel, and packaging sectors scramble to meet ambitious net-zero targets, the need for reliable, industrial-scale bio-materials has never been higher. 

Primient’s decision to take full ownership allows for a more integrated approach to manufacturing and product development. By leveraging its extensive expertise in corn-based feedstocks and large-scale fermentation, the company is well-positioned to drive the next generation of sustainable chemistry. Susterra® PDO, in particular, is lauded for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to its fossil-based counterparts, making it a cornerstone of Primient’s environmental strategy.

## Looking Toward a Circular Economy

Industry analysts view this acquisition as a clear indicator of the maturing bioplastics market. By bringing Primient Covation fully under its wing, Primient is not just expanding its portfolio but is also strengthening the infrastructure necessary for a circular economy. The move is expected to enhance supply chain transparency and provide customers with more robust technical support as they transition toward renewable materials.

As Primient integrates the new assets, the company remains focused on its core mission: delivering plant-based ingredients that do not compromise on performance. With total control over its PDO production, the future of bio-based plastics looks increasingly bright.
