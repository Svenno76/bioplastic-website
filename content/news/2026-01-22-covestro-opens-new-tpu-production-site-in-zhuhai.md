Covestro has officially inaugurated its new Thermoplastic Polyurethanes (TPU) production site in Zhuhai, South China. This significant expansion creates the company’s largest TPU production site worldwide, reinforcing its commitment to the Asia-Pacific region. The facility is strategically positioned to serve the booming manufacturing hubs of the Greater Bay Area, specifically targeting the IT, consumer electronics, and footwear industries.

## Strengthening Regional Capacity

The integration of the new site into the existing Zhuhai manufacturing complex allows Covestro to leverage established infrastructure while significantly boosting annual production capacity. This move is designed to meet the rising demand for high-performance elastomers in China, which remains the world’s largest market for TPU.

By localizing production capacity, Covestro aims to shorten lead times and enhance collaboration with local OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers). The proximity to innovation centers in Shenzhen and Guangzhou facilitates faster development cycles for custom material solutions, particularly for injection molding and extrusion applications.

## focus on Sustainable Material Solutions

A primary focus of the new Zhuhai facility is the production of Covestro’s sustainable product portfolio. The lines are equipped to manufacture the *Desmopan®* brand of TPUs, including bio-based and recycled-content variants. These materials are engineered to help downstream customers reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing the material's essential mechanical properties, such as high abrasion resistance, flexibility, and durability.

The plant operates under strict environmental standards, utilizing advanced process technologies to minimize energy consumption and waste. This investment aligns with Covestro’s global strategy to become fully circular, supporting the industry's transition from fossil-based resources to alternative raw materials including biomass and recycled feedstocks.
