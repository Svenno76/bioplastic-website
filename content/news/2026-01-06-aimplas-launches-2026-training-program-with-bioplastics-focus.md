AIMPLAS, the Plastics Technology Centre, has unveiled its comprehensive 2026 training program featuring over 70 activities designed to equip industry professionals with cutting-edge knowledge in sustainable materials and circular economy practices. Launching through its Plastics Academy platform, the initiative represents a significant investment in workforce development for the plastics sector, with professional titles alone comprising 800 hours of specialized instruction. The program addresses critical industry challenges, particularly regulatory compliance and sustainability innovation.

## Product Innovation

The 2026 program introduces a new **Professional Expert Title in Legislation in the Plastics Sector**, directly addressing regulatory complexity across the value chain. This addition covers European and national legislation governing food contact materials, packaging, sustainability, recycling, and chemical safety. Beyond regulatory training, AIMPLAS offers sector-specific courses in packaging, construction, and mobility, alongside cross-cutting technical modules in extrusion, injection molding, and compounding. Notably, 24 dedicated training activities focus on circular economy topics, including recycling technologies, bioplastics, end-of-waste status, and the emerging Greenwashing Directive.

## Applications

The program's emphasis on bioplastics and circular economy reflects industry transformation priorities. By combining theoretical learning with practical case studies, AIMPLAS enables professionals to anticipate regulatory changes and ensure legal compliance. The training addresses quality, raw materials characterization, and biodegradable product development—essential competencies as bioplastics production accelerates. Additionally, AIMPLAS will host the ninth edition of its International Seminar on Biopolymers and Sustainable Composites, reinforcing its position as a benchmark institution in biopolymer development and innovation.
