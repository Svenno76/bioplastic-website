## Strategic Expansion into Green Infrastructure

Tiderock Companies (OTC: TDRK) has officially announced the formation of a new division, Vivara Global, dedicated to advancing sustainable development and infrastructure. This strategic expansion marks a significant shift for the holding company, moving aggressively into the implementation of green building technologies and material science solutions designed to reduce the carbon footprint of the built environment.

Vivara Global will function as the primary vehicle for Tiderock’s sustainability initiatives, specifically focusing on the intersection of residential development and advanced eco-friendly materials. The division aims to tackle the growing demand for net-zero housing by integrating vertical supply chains that prioritize renewable resources over traditional, carbon-intensive construction methods.

## Integration of Bio-Based Materials

A central pillar of Vivara Global’s operational mandate is the utilization of next-generation biocomposites and bio-based polymers in construction applications. By leveraging material innovation, the division intends to deploy structural and non-structural components derived from renewable feedstock.

The initiative highlights the industry's pivot toward bioplastics in construction, moving beyond packaging applications into durable goods. Vivara Global is expected to explore the use of high-density biocomposites for flooring, decking, and insulation systems, as well as engineered wood products bonded with bio-based resins. These materials offer the dual benefit of carbon sequestration and reduced reliance on petrochemical derivatives typically found in PVC and traditional insulation foams.

## Meeting 2026 Sustainability Goals

The launch aligns with broader 2026 industry trends requiring stricter adherence to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria in real estate development. Tiderock Companies has positioned Vivara to not only develop properties but to serve as a testbed for scalable sustainable technologies. Management indicated that the division will seek to partner with bioplastic producers and material scientists to refine the durability and thermal properties of these green construction materials, ensuring they meet rigorous building codes while maintaining environmental integrity.
