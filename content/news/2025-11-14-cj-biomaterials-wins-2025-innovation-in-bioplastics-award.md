CJ Biomaterials has been honored with the 2025 Innovation in Bioplastics Award by the Plastics Industry Association, recognizing its pioneering advancements in biopolymer technology and sustainable materials. The award was presented during Bioplastics Week, highlighting CJ Biomaterials’ leadership in developing next-generation bioplastics that address global plastic pollution and support the transition to a circular bioeconomy.

## Certification Details

The award specifically recognizes CJ Biomaterials’ PHACT™ PHA technology, a 100% bio-based, industrially and home compostable biopolymer. PHACT™ PHA is certified for biodegradability in soil, marine environments, and composting facilities, and is free from persistent microplastics. The company’s proprietary fermentation process produces both amorphous and semi-crystalline PHAs, enabling versatile applications across packaging, consumer goods, and industrial products.

## Market Significance

CJ Biomaterials’ achievement underscores the growing importance of high-performance, truly biodegradable bioplastics in the global effort to replace fossil-based plastics. The company’s scalable production and strategic partnerships—such as with NatureWorks and BIQ Materials—demonstrate the viability of PHA-based solutions for mainstream markets. This recognition reinforces the industry’s shift toward materials that are not only sustainable but also designed for real-world end-of-life scenarios, accelerating the adoption of circular economy principles in the plastics sector.
