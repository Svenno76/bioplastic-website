At the 2026 Medical Design & Manufacturing (MD&M) West exhibition, SABIC introduced a significant advancement in medical material science with the launch of its new LNP™ LUBRICOMP™ compounds. These materials are engineered specifically to replace fluoropolymers in medical tubing, addressing the urgent industry shift away from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).

## Addressing the PFAS Challenge in Healthcare

The medical device industry is currently navigating a complex regulatory landscape regarding "forever chemicals." Traditional fluoropolymers, often used for their inherent lubricity in applications like catheters and surgical tubing, are facing scrutiny due to potential environmental and health risks associated with PFAS.

SABIC’s new portfolio provides a strategic solution for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) looking to future-proof their supply chains. By eliminating the reliance on fluorinated chemistry, these compounds allow manufacturers to stay ahead of evolving global regulations, such as those proposed by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and various U.S. state legislations, without sacrificing the critical performance metrics required in clinical settings.

## Technical Specifications and Tribological Performance

The new LNP LUBRICOMP compounds are formulated to replicate the tribological properties—specifically low friction and wear resistance—traditionally provided by Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). SABIC has achieved this through a proprietary lubricating technology that does not utilize fluoropolymers.

Key technical features include:

*   **High Lubricity:** The materials offer low coefficient of friction (COF) performance essential for the smooth insertion and navigation of medical tubing within the body.
*   **Biocompatibility:** The compounds have been assessed according to ISO 10993 standards, ensuring they are safe for limited-contact medical devices.
*   **Processability:** Unlike some high-performance fluoropolymers which require specialized processing equipment, these thermoplastic compounds can be processed using standard injection molding and extrusion machinery, potentially lowering manufacturing costs.

This launch reinforces SABIC's commitment to the "Chemistry that Matters™" ethos, providing the healthcare sector with sustainable, high-performance alternatives that ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance.
