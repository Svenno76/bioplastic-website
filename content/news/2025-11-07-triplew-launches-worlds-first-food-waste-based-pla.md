TripleW, an innovative circular chemistry company, has launched the world's first polylactic acid (PLA) bioplastic made entirely from food waste. Supported by Sulzer Chemtech, this breakthrough was announced in November 2025 and represents a significant advancement in sustainable bioplastics production. The launch took place in Antwerp, Belgium, where TripleW operates a demonstration plant, marking a key milestone in the circular economy by transforming food industry side streams into valuable raw materials.

## Product Innovation

TripleW’s new PLA bioplastic is produced using their proprietary fermentation technology that converts food waste—such as bakery rejects and expired logistics returns—into lactic acid, the building block of PLA. This process utilizes microorganisms to ferment the food waste slurry, yielding a high-purity lactic acid product branded as Circulac®. The collaboration with Sulzer Chemtech, which provides advanced polymer processing expertise, enables the scalable production of this fully circular PLA. This innovation drastically reduces reliance on fossil fuels and lowers cradle-to-grave CO₂ emissions by up to 75% compared to conventional plastics.

## Applications

The introduction of food waste-based PLA opens new avenues for sustainable materials in consumer goods, packaging, personal care, and homecare products. By valorizing underutilized waste streams, TripleW’s technology supports large-scale bioplastic adoption and circularity in the plastics industry. This advancement not only mitigates environmental impact but also offers a cost-effective alternative to fossil-based plastics, reinforcing TripleW’s leadership in closing the loop on food and plastic waste.
