Balrampur Chini Mills Limited is set to establish India’s first large-scale polylactic acid (PLA) bioplastics plant by October 2026. Operating under the brand name Bioyug, the facility will be located in Uttar Pradesh and aims to produce 80,000 tonnes of compostable bioplastics annually. This ₹2,850 crore project marks a significant milestone in India’s transition toward sustainable manufacturing by utilizing sugarcane as the primary raw material to create eco-friendly plastics.

## Facility Details

The new plant will be a fully integrated, greenfield facility situated adjacent to an existing sugar plant to leverage local infrastructure. It will convert sugarcane-derived sugars into lactic acid, which is then polymerized into PLA—a bio-based, compostable plastic that closely resembles conventional plastics but with a much shorter carbon cycle. Commissioning is scheduled for October 2026, with production expected to begin by November 2026. The project aligns with India’s sustainability goals, aiming to reduce single-use plastic waste and support the country’s net-zero emissions target by 2070.

## Market Impact

Balrampur Chini’s PLA plant represents a transformative step for India’s bioplastics industry, offering a scalable alternative to fossil-fuel-based plastics. By producing 80,000 tonnes annually, the facility will help address India’s growing plastic waste challenge and regulatory pressures on single-use plastics. The Bioyug initiative is expected to catalyze the adoption of bio-based materials across packaging, food service, and biomedical sectors, while also creating a new revenue stream for the sugar industry through green chemistry and circular economy principles. This venture positions Balrampur Chini as a pioneer in India’s bio-circular economy transition.
