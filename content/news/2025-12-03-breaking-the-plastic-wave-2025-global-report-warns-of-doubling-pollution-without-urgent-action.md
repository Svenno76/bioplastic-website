The Pew Charitable Trusts released a landmark report warning that **plastic pollution will more than double from 130 million to 280 million metric tons by 2040** unless urgent systemic action is implemented globally. Published in December 2025, "Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025" reveals that plastic production will grow 52% over the next 15 years, outpacing waste management capacity expansion. The analysis, developed with support from Systemiq and other leading institutions, underscores the accelerating environmental and health crisis driven by rising consumption patterns worldwide.

## Background

The report identifies four strategic pillars for transformation: reducing plastic production and use, redesigning products and systems, expanding waste management infrastructure, and promoting sustainable materials innovation. Crucially, the analysis demonstrates that **existing solutions can cut plastic pollution by 83% by 2040**, including measures to reduce primary plastic production by 14% from 2025 levels while maintaining consumer service levels. Implementation could nearly eliminate packaging pollution, reduce plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions by 38%, and cut health impacts by 54%.

## Significance

For the bioplastics and sustainable materials sector, the report represents a pivotal market opportunity. The recommended transformation could unlock a **multi-trillion-dollar sustainable solutions market** while creating 8.6 million jobs globally. However, the findings emphasize that innovation alone is insufficient—systemic policy changes, including production reduction targets and subsidy elimination, are essential. The report warns that delaying action by five years would add 540 million metric tons of plastic to the environment and cost governments an additional US$27 billion annually.
