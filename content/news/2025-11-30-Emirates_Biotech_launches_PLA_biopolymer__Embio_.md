## Details
Emirates Biotech, a company based in the United Arab Emirates, has officially launched 'Embio', its new product line of PolyLactic Acid (PLA) biopolymers. This strategic introduction provides a plant-based, renewable alternative to traditional plastics, aiming to significantly advance sustainable material adoption in the Middle East. The name 'Embio' itself signifies a biopolymer produced in the UAE, reflecting the company's regional roots and commitment to biotechnology and sustainability.

The Embio portfolio includes various PLA grades engineered for diverse applications, such as rigid and flexible packaging, coated paperboard, fibers, nonwovens, and 3D printing. These biopolymers boast high clarity, strength, and processability, coupled with a substantially lower carbon footprint compared to conventional plastics. Furthermore, Embio PLA grades are designed to be recyclable or industrially compostable, ensuring they do not leave behind persistent microplastics in the environment, thereby supporting regional waste reduction and circular economy initiatives.

## Impact
Emirates Biotech is actively pre-marketing Embio across the Middle East, with a focus on ensuring local stock availability. This approach facilitates quicker delivery times and offers lower minimum order quantities, making it easier for regional converters, brand owners, and packaging manufacturers to transition to more sustainable, plant-based materials. Marc Verbruggen, CEO of Emirates Biotech, emphasized that the launch of Embio represents a major milestone in making renewable and compostable plastics accessible throughout the region, underscoring the company's commitment to innovation and reducing dependence on fossil resources. The company's technical team will also provide support for processing trials and application development, ensuring a seamless integration of Embio grades into existing production lines. This initiative aligns with the UAE's broader sustainability goals, including its national commitment to Net Zero 2050.
