## Details

Braskem America, a leader in biopolymer production, has announced an expanded production capacity for its 'I'm green' bio-based polyethylene (PE). This plant-based biopolymer is a drop-in solution, offering the same performance characteristics as traditional fossil-based PE while providing significant environmental benefits. The 'I'm green' PE is derived from sustainably sourced sugarcane ethanol, which actively captures CO2 from the atmosphere during its growth cycle, contributing to a negative carbon footprint.

The company's green ethylene plant, located in the Petrochemical Complex of Triunfo, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has seen its capacity increase to 275,000 tons per year by 2025. This represents a 37% increase since the initial project began in 2010 and follows an earlier expansion in June 2023, which raised capacity to 260,000 tons/year with an $87 million investment. Braskem's ambition is to further increase its biopolymer production to one million tons annually by 2030.

## Impact

The expanded capacity for 'I'm green' bio-based PE addresses the growing global demand for sustainable materials across various industries. This bio-based plastic is 100% recyclable within existing polyethylene recycling streams, making it a viable alternative for applications such as food and cosmetics packaging, reusable water bottles, footwear, toys, wires, and cables. Each ton of 'I'm green' bio-based polyethylene produced sequesters a substantial amount of CO2 from the atmosphere, with some grades offsetting the annual emissions equivalent to thousands of U.S. citizens. This commitment aligns with Braskem's broader goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and champion a circular economy.
