NaturePlast, a French leader in bio-based and biodegradable plastics based in Caen, has announced the development of new-generation bioplastic formulations for technical filaments used in fishing and construction nets. Leveraging artificial intelligence through the EU-funded DiMAT project, the company aims to optimize the performance characteristics of these materials to meet the demanding requirements of these sectors. This innovation was revealed in November 2025, highlighting NaturePlast’s commitment to sustainability and digital transformation in traditional industries.

## Product Innovation

NaturePlast’s new bioplastic filaments are designed using AI-driven digital modeling tools that simulate and predict material behavior, significantly reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical tests. These filaments achieve precise properties such as stretchability, heat resistance, fluidity, and cooling rates, which are critical for durable fishing and construction nets. By integrating DiMAT’s data-driven optimization into its R&D process, NaturePlast has accelerated innovation while cutting raw material use and energy consumption, resulting in stronger, greener, and more sustainable products.

## Applications

This advancement addresses the critical issue of plastic pollution in marine environments by offering biodegradable alternatives to conventional synthetic nets, which often persist for decades. NaturePlast’s AI-designed bioplastics support circular economy principles and contribute to reducing ghost fishing and microplastic contamination. Moreover, the company’s work strengthens regional industrial innovation in Normandy and aligns with France’s national priorities for reindustrialization, decarbonization, and digitalization, positioning NaturePlast as a key player in the sustainable materials industry.
