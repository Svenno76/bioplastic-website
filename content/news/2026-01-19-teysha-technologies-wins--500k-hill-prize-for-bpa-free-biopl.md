## A Major Milestone for Sustainable Materials

Teysha Technologies, a leader in the development of renewable polycarbonate alternatives, has been announced as the winner of the prestigious $500,000 Hill Prize. This high-profile award recognizes research that demonstrates significant potential for real-world impact, specifically focusing on solutions that address urgent global environmental challenges.

The prize underscores the commercial and ecological importance of Teysha’s flagship "AggiePol®" technology. As industries worldwide scramble to meet stricter environmental regulations and consumer demand for "green" chemistry, Teysha’s breakthrough offers a path forward that does not rely on fossil fuels or toxic chemical precursors.

## Eliminating BPA with AggiePol®

At the heart of Teysha’s innovation is the elimination of Bisphenol A (BPA), a common building block in traditional polycarbonates. BPA has long been a subject of concern for health experts due to its role as an endocrine disruptor. By utilizing a "tunable" platform derived from agricultural waste and natural feedstocks, Teysha has created a bioplastic that mimics the durability and clarity of traditional plastics without the associated health risks.

The "tunability" of AggiePol® is its most distinctive feature. Unlike many bioplastics that have fixed physical properties, Teysha’s platform allows engineers to adjust the mechanical, thermal, and chemical characteristics of the material. This means the plastic can be customized to degrade within weeks in a marine environment or last for years in high-performance industrial applications.

## Scaling for a Circular Economy

The $500,000 Hill Prize will be instrumental in bridging the gap between laboratory success and industrial-scale production. Teysha Technologies intends to use the funds to accelerate the commercialization of their materials, focusing on sectors such as food packaging, medical devices, and automotive components.

As the global community moves toward a circular economy, the recognition of Teysha’s work signals a shift in the bioplastics industry. The focus is no longer just on making materials that are "less harmful," but on creating high-performance alternatives that are restorative by design.
