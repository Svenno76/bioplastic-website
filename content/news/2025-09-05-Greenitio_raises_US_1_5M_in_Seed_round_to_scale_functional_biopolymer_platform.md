## Details
Greenitio, a Singapore-based startup pioneering sustainable biopolymers, announced on September 5, 2025, that it has successfully raised US$1.5 million in Seed funding. The investment round was spearheaded by SGInnovate, with significant participation from Better Bite Ventures, Silverstrand Capital, and various existing angel investors from the chemicals and cosmetics sectors. This capital infusion is earmarked to accelerate Greenitio's journey towards commercial readiness, focusing on scaling manufacturing capabilities, securing crucial regulatory approvals, and forging extensive commercial partnerships with global cosmetics and chemical enterprises.

Founded in 2021, Greenitio has developed a proprietary and patented green chemistry platform designed to create functional biopolymers. These innovative materials are derived from fungal chitosan, offering a sustainable and high-performance alternative to microplastic and petrochemical ingredients prevalent in cosmetics, personal care, home care, and other specialty chemical applications. The company's technology is crucial amidst growing concerns over microplastic pollution and evolving regulations, such as impending EU microplastics bans.

## Impact and Future Outlook
Greenitio's biopolymers, including flagship lines like Chitosola™, Chitobe™, and Chitobela™, are engineered to deliver multiple benefits, such as SPF-boosting, film-forming performance, water-resistance, anti-inflammatory properties, and deep moisturization. Notably, their production process is water-based, eliminating chemical waste and significantly reducing the carbon footprint by an estimated 87% compared to conventional chemical methods. These materials are 100% bio-based and naturally degradable.

Dr. Amit Kumar Khan, CEO and Co-founder of Greenitio, emphasized that the funding provides the necessary "runway" for transitioning from lab-scale validation to real-world deployment, citing strong interest from formulation and sustainability teams across various industries. To support its ambitious growth and meet increasing demand from European partners, Greenitio plans to establish a dedicated subsidiary in the Benelux region, leveraging its strategic location and established chemical and cosmetics industry ecosystem. This move is set to solidify Greenitio's position as a key player in providing eco-friendly, high-performance ingredients globally.
