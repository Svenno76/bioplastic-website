## Details of the New Bioeconomy Strategy

The European Commission officially adopted a new Bioeconomy Strategy on November 27, 2025, marking a significant step towards a more sustainable and competitive European economy. This strategy places a strong emphasis on leveraging biological resources from land and sea to replace fossil-based materials across various sectors. A key component of this revised strategy is the explicit inclusion of bio-based plastics within a coherent regulatory framework, particularly under the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR) architecture.

The Commission intends to prepare for legally binding targets for bio-based products, aiming to stimulate demand and drive the transition away from fossil dependence. This move signals that bio-based plastics are now a priority in EU industrial policy, confirming their role as a strategic pillar for Europe's future industrial base and acknowledging their potential to scale up the EU bioeconomy.

## Impact and Objectives

The strategy seeks to unlock substantial investment and facilitate the scale-up of innovative bio-based materials and technologies. European Commissioner for the Environment, Jessika Roswall, highlighted that this initiative is geared towards "growth, decarbonisation, and jobs in Europe". The Commission has identified high-potential markets including bio-based plastics, fibres, textiles, chemicals, and construction materials, which are expected to contribute significantly to both economic growth and environmental benefits.

To achieve its ambitious goals, the strategy proposes concrete actions such as establishing a Bio-based Europe Alliance. This alliance aims to aggregate up to €10 billion of demand for bio-based materials by 2030, creating a strong market pull for sustainable solutions. Additionally, a Bioeconomy Investment Deployment Group will be convened to stimulate private investment, reduce risk, and build a pipeline of bankable projects. The strategy also stresses the importance of responsible biomass sourcing, promoting circularity, and enhancing the value of secondary biomass, such as agricultural residues and organic waste, to ensure environmental sustainability.
