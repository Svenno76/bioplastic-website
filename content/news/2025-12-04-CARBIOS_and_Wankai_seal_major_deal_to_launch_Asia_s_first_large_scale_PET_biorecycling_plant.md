## Details

France's CARBIOS and China's Wankai New Materials have officially finalized a definitive agreement to construct Asia's inaugural large-scale polyethylene terephthalate (PET) biorecycling plant. The landmark deal, signed on December 2, 2025, establishes a joint venture to build and operate the advanced facility in Haining, Zhejiang province, China. This initiative marks a significant advancement in sustainable plastic management within Asia.

The planned plant will boast an annual processing capacity of 50,000 tons of PET waste, utilizing CARBIOS's patented enzymatic depolymerization technology to transform plastic waste into virgin-grade PET. Wankai New Materials, a subsidiary of Zhink Group and a leading PET producer globally, will hold a 70% stake in the joint venture, with CARBIOS retaining 30%. The estimated construction cost for the project is €115 million, financed with 30% equity and 70% debt, with Wankai guaranteeing the debt portion. Leveraging Wankai's existing infrastructure at the Haining site will help reduce overall investment costs.

## Timeline and Impact

Construction of the facility is projected to commence in the first quarter of 2026, with commissioning targeted for the first quarter of 2027. Beyond this initial plant, CARBIOS and Wankai have committed to a long-term partnership with ambitions to develop and operate multiple PET biorecycling plants across Asia. The agreement also includes an exclusive three-year license for CARBIOS's PET depolymerization technology to Wankai in Asia, with provisions for extensions based on additional capacity commitments. Furthermore, Wankai has pledged to invest €5 million in CARBIOS's share capital by June 2026, with the potential to appoint a representative to CARBIOS's Board of Directors. This strategic alliance underscores a major step towards fostering a circular economy for plastics in the region.
