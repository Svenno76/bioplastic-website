European Bioplastics (EUBP) unveiled its 2025 Market Development Update at EBC25 in Berlin, presenting robust data that forecasts a significant expansion in global biobased plastics production capacity. The report projects that capacity will nearly double from 2.31 million tonnes in 2025 to approximately 4.69 million tonnes by 2030. This growth underscores the industry's crucial role in fostering a sustainable, circular economy.

## Details

The EUBP report, compiled in cooperation with the nova-Institute, highlights that this upward trend is fueled by rising market demand and continuous innovation in material performance and applications. While biobased plastics currently constitute about 0.5% of the 431 million tonnes of global plastics produced annually, their diversified use across various sectors is gaining momentum. Key polymers driving this expansion include polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polylactic acid (PLA), bio-polypropylene (bioPP), and bio-polyethylene (bioPE). Europe, specifically the EU27+3 region, is witnessing concentrated growth in additional capacities for bioPP, bioPE, and PHA.

## Impact and Applications

Bioplastics are increasingly integrated into diverse industries, notably packaging, textiles & fibres, consumer goods, automotive, and agriculture. Packaging remains the largest market segment, accounting for 41.3% (0.95 million tonnes) of global bioplastics production capacities in 2025. The automotive and transport sector also shows significant growth, now representing 10.3% of applications with 0.24 million tonnes. Hasso von Pogrell, Managing Director of EUBP, emphasized that the steady rise in biobased plastics production reinforces the industry's contribution to a more sustainable, circular economy, driven by consumer and regulatory focus on low-impact materials. The industry operated at an average global capacity utilization rate of 72% in 2025. Future market growth, according to the report, will hinge on clear and stable policies that encourage innovation and investment.
