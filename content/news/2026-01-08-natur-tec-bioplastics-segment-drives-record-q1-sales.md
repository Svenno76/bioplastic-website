## Record-Breaking Performance in Q1

Northern Technologies International Corporation (NTIC) has officially kicked off fiscal 2026 on a high note, announcing record-breaking net sales for the first quarter ended November 30, 2025. This surge in financial performance was primarily catalyzed by the robust growth of its Natur-Tec® bioplastics division, which continues to capture significant market share as global industries pivot toward sustainable packaging solutions.

The company reported that the demand for its certified compostable and biobased plastics has reached an all-time high. This growth reflects a broader macroeconomic shift where brands are increasingly seeking alternatives to traditional petroleum-based plastics to meet both regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for environmental responsibility.

## Natur-Tec Leading the Sustainable Charge

While NTIC’s Zerust® corrosion inhibitor business remains a stable pillar for the company, the Natur-Tec segment has emerged as the primary engine of expansion. The bioplastics division saw a substantial year-over-year increase in sales, driven largely by high-volume orders in North America and the Indian subcontinent. 

Natur-Tec products, which include compostable bags, films, and injection-molded resins, are being integrated into diverse supply chains ranging from food service to industrial packaging. The versatility and performance of these biopolymers—often matching the durability of conventional plastics—have made them a preferred choice for large-scale commercial adoptions.

## Future Outlook and Strategic Growth

In the quarterly earnings call, NTIC leadership emphasized their commitment to further R&D and production scaling. "The record results this quarter demonstrate the successful execution of our long-term strategy to lead the bioplastics revolution," the company noted. By focusing on high-performance compostable materials that leave zero microplastic residue, NTIC is positioning itself at the forefront of the circular economy.

As the global regulatory landscape tightens around single-use plastics, NTIC’s early investments in bio-based technology are yielding significant dividends, setting a strong precedent for the remainder of fiscal 2026.
