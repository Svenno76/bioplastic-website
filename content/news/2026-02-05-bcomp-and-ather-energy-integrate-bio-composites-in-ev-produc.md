## Pioneering Sustainable Mobility in India

Swiss sustainable lightweighting solutions provider Bcomp and India’s leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, Ather Energy, have formally integrated advanced bio-composite materials into the production line of the high-performance Ather 450 Apex electric scooter. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the automotive industry, signaling a shift from traditional petrochemical plastics toward renewable, high-performance natural fiber technologies in mass-market vehicles.

The partnership leverages Bcomp’s proprietary technologies to replace standard ABS and polycarbonate body panels with sustainable alternatives, addressing the growing demand for decarbonization in the rapidly expanding Indian EV sector.

## Technical Superiority of Flax Fibers

At the core of this integration is Bcomp’s **ampliTex™** technical fabric. Derived from European flax fibers, this material offers a unique combination of sustainability and mechanical performance. Unlike traditional carbon fiber or fiberglass, ampliTex™ provides significant weight reduction without compromising rigidity.

For the Ather 450 Apex, the implementation of these bio-composites serves a dual purpose. Firstly, the material’s high specific stiffness contributes to lightweighting, which is critical for maximizing battery range and improving handling agility. Secondly, flax fibers possess inherent vibration-damping properties, offering a smoother ride quality. Furthermore, in the event of a crash, the bio-composite panels exhibit a safe, non-shattering fracture behavior, eliminating the risk of sharp debris associated with standard brittle plastics.

## Scaling Bio-Economy Solutions

This collaboration moves natural fiber composites beyond niche motorsports applications and into high-volume consumer goods. By adopting Bcomp’s flax-based solutions, Ather Energy reports a significant reduction in the CO2 footprint of the vehicle's bodywork compared to synthetic counterparts. The initiative demonstrates that bio-based materials can survive the rigors of daily urban commuting while supporting a circular economy, as the flax fibers are fully renewable and allow for energy recovery at the end of the product's life.
