**CJ Biomaterials and NatureWorks Advance Sustainable Packaging with Novel Biopolymer Compounds**

Two industry leaders in biopolymer innovation have expanded their collaboration to commercialize advanced flexible packaging solutions. CJ Biomaterials, a division of South Korea-based CJ CheilJedang, and NatureWorks, the global leader in polylactic acid (PLA) production, have jointly developed biopolymer compounds combining CJ Biomaterials' **PHACT® amorphous PHA** with NatureWorks' **Ingeo™ PLA** technology. The partnership, formalized through a Master Collaboration Agreement signed in November 2022, represents a significant step toward replacing fossil fuel-based plastics across multiple applications.

## Collaboration Details

The two companies introduced compounds specifically engineered for compostable film packaging applications, including blown, cast, and machine direction orientation (MDO) film formats. By blending amorphous PHA—a softer, more rubbery polymer variant—with PLA, the partners have achieved improved mechanical properties including enhanced toughness and ductility while maintaining material clarity. This combination enables adjustable biodegradability profiles and potential home compostability, addressing diverse end-of-life scenarios from industrial composting to chemical recycling.

## Expected Outcomes

The collaboration positions both companies to capture growing demand for sustainable packaging materials across food service, personal care, and hygiene applications. By combining their complementary technologies and expertise, CJ Biomaterials and NatureWorks aim to deliver next-generation solutions that accelerate industry adoption of bio-based alternatives. The partnership demonstrates how strategic collaboration between leading biopolymer producers can drive innovation and expand the practical applications of sustainable materials in the circular economy.
