## Details

An academic from Imperial College London has significantly contributed to the "Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025" report, a landmark global assessment released by The Pew Charitable Trusts and its thought partners, including the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Systemiq, and the University of Oxford. The report paints a stark picture, warning that without ambitious global action, plastic pollution will more than double by 2040, surging from 130 million to 280 million metric tons annually. This increase is largely driven by plastic production outpacing waste management capabilities.

Dr. Costas Velis, an Associate Professor in Waste and Resource Engineering at Imperial's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, was a key contributor. His expertise in waste management, informal recycling networks, and plastic flow modeling was central to the analysis. The report's "System Transformation" scenario outlines a pathway to dramatically reduce annual plastic pollution by 83% and virtually eliminate plastic packaging pollution by 2040. This achievable goal relies on a systemic shift towards reuse, product redesign, and substantial investment redirection from single-use plastics to sustainable alternatives. The report also highlights that without intervention, plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions could rise by 58%, and health impacts by 75% by 2040.

## Impact

The "Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025" report serves as an urgent call to action, emphasizing that the escalating plastic crisis has profound environmental, human health, and economic consequences. Dr. Velis stressed that plastic pollution, leading to issues like cancer, heart disease, and asthma, is not an inevitable outcome. The proposed solutions, grounded in rigorous science, underscore the critical need for coordinated global action and immediate investment in improved waste management and infrastructure, particularly in vulnerable communities in the Global South. Furthermore, the report advocates for a just transition that integrates informal waste workers, who play a vital role in global recycling efforts, ensuring fair pay and safe conditions. Implementing these solutions could also yield significant economic benefits, saving governments an estimated US$19 billion annually by 2040.
