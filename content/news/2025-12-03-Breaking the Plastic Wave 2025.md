## Details

The Pew Charitable Trusts, in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Systemiq, and the University of Oxford, has released "Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025," a comprehensive global assessment of the escalating plastic pollution crisis. The report delivers a stark warning: without ambitious coordinated action, annual plastic pollution will surge from 130 million metric tons to 280 million metric tons by 2040—more than doubling current levels. This dramatic increase stems from plastic production rapidly outpacing global waste management capabilities.

However, the report also presents an achievable pathway forward. Its "System Transformation" scenario demonstrates that annual plastic pollution can be reduced by 83%, with plastic packaging pollution virtually eliminated by 2040. This ambitious but attainable goal requires a fundamental shift in how society produces, uses, and manages plastics. Key interventions include widespread adoption of reuse systems, comprehensive product redesign to eliminate problematic plastics, and major investment redirection away from single-use plastics toward sustainable alternatives and improved waste management infrastructure.

The report emphasizes that inaction carries severe consequences beyond environmental damage. Without intervention, plastic-related greenhouse gas emissions will rise by 58%, while health impacts—including increased risks of cancer, heart disease, and asthma—will surge by 75% by 2040. The analysis also highlights the disproportionate burden on vulnerable communities, particularly in the Global South, where inadequate waste infrastructure exacerbates the crisis.

## Impact

"Breaking the Plastic Wave 2025" provides policymakers, businesses, and civil society with a science-based roadmap for tackling one of the world's most pressing environmental challenges. The report underscores that current trajectories are unsustainable and that the plastic crisis is not inevitable but rather a solvable problem requiring immediate, coordinated global action.

Implementing the proposed solutions offers substantial economic benefits alongside environmental gains. Governments could save an estimated US$19 billion annually by 2040 through reduced waste management costs and improved public health outcomes. The report also advocates for a just transition that integrates informal waste workers—who handle significant portions of global recycling—ensuring fair compensation and safe working conditions as part of the transformation.
