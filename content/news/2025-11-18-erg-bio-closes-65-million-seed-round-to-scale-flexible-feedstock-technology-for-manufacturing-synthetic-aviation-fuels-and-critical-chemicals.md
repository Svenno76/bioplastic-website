**Erg Bio**, a California-based biomanufacturing startup, has closed a **$6.5 million seed round** to advance its innovative Aspire™ technology platform for producing synthetic aviation fuels and bio-based chemicals from waste biomass. The funding, announced in November 2025, positions the company to accelerate commercialization of its flexible feedstock technology at a critical time for U.S. energy security and industrial resilience.

## Funding Details

The seed round was led by **Azolla Ventures**, with participation from **Chevron Technology Ventures**, Freeflow, Plug and Play, and strategic angel investors. The capital will support Erg Bio's transition to pilot-scale operations, technical validation, and production of multi-kilogram batches of fuel and materials intermediates from agricultural residues. The company also plans to secure offtake agreements, expand its technical and commercial teams, and complete engineering designs for its first commercial plant.

## Strategic Use

Erg Bio's **low-temperature solvent pretreatment process** represents a significant advancement for the bioeconomy. The technology processes over 30 different biomass feedstocks—including agricultural and forestry waste—delivering 90-95% sugar recovery compared to traditional methods yielding 75-80%. This flexibility addresses a longstanding bottleneck in cellulosic ethanol production, potentially unlocking an untapped market. By converting waste biomass into fermentable sugars and high-value intermediates, Erg Bio strengthens domestic manufacturing capacity while promoting cost-competitive, sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based chemicals and fuels.
