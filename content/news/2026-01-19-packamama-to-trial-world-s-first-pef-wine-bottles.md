Packamama, the packaging innovator known for its space-saving flat wine bottles, has signed a strategic capacity reservation agreement with Dutch technology company Avantium. This collaboration marks a significant milestone in the beverage industry, as Packamama prepares to trial the world’s first wine bottles made from Polyethylene Furanoate (PEF).

## Pioneering Plant-Based Packaging

Under the terms of the agreement, Packamama has secured a supply of ReLeaf, Avantium’s proprietary brand of PEF. Unlike conventional PET (polyethylene terephthalate) used in standard plastic bottles, PEF is a 100% plant-based, recyclable polymer derived from furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). 

This partnership aligns with the operational scaling of Avantium’s FDCA Flagship Plant, allowing Packamama to integrate this next-generation material into its eco-flat bottle designs. The move represents a major leap away from fossil-fuel-based plastics and energy-intensive glass packaging, targeting a substantial reduction in carbon footprint for the wine logistics sector.

## Superior Barrier Properties for Wine

While traditional bioplastics have often struggled to meet the rigorous preservation standards required for wine, PEF offers a technical breakthrough. The material exhibits superior barrier properties compared to standard PET, boasting significantly higher resistance to oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability. 

For winemakers, this is a critical development. The enhanced oxygen barrier protects the wine from oxidation, extending the shelf life beyond what current plastic packaging can offer. This makes PEF a viable, lightweight alternative to glass, capable of maintaining the integrity of sensitive vintages while drastically reducing transport weight and associated emissions.

## A Circular Future

The trial aims to validate both the consumer appeal and the technical performance of PEF bottles in real-world supply chains. Beyond its bio-based origins, PEF is designed to fit into existing recycling streams. Because it is chemically similar to PET, it can be recycled within current infrastructure, though it also holds the potential for closed-loop recycling as adoption scales.

By combining Packamama’s efficient geometric design with Avantium’s advanced material science, the two companies are setting a new standard for sustainable beverage packaging.
