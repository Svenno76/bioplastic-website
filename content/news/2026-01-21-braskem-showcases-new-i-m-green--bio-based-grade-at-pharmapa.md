At Pharmapack 2026 in Paris, Braskem has unveiled a significant expansion to its sustainable portfolio with a new grade of I'm green™ bio-based polyethylene specifically engineered for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. The move underscores the growing demand for renewable materials within highly regulated sectors that have traditionally relied on virgin fossil-based polymers due to strict purity requirements.

## Meeting Rigorous Pharma Standards

The newly showcased grade is a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) derivative produced from sugarcane ethanol. According to Braskem, this material serves as a drop-in solution for pharmaceutical packaging converters, offering the same chemical and mechanical properties as conventional fossil-based polyethylene. 

Critically, the new grade has undergone extensive testing to ensure compliance with international pharmacopeia standards. This ensures that the transition to a bio-based feedstock does not compromise the safety, stability, or barrier properties required for sensitive medical applications, such as pill bottles, caps, and closures. Because the material is chemically identical to fossil PE, it remains fully recyclable within existing polyolefin recycling streams, addressing both the beginning and end of the product life cycle.

## Decarbonizing the Medical Supply Chain

The pharmaceutical industry is under increasing pressure to reduce Scope 3 emissions, which encompasses the carbon footprint of the supply chain including packaging materials. Braskem’s I'm green™ bio-based polyethylene captures CO2 from the atmosphere during the sugarcane cultivation process, resulting in a negative carbon footprint at the plant gate. 

By integrating this material into packaging lines, pharmaceutical companies can significantly lower the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of their products. Braskem highlighted that this launch is part of their broader strategy to achieve carbon neutrality and to support the healthcare sector’s transition toward a circular economy without sacrificing material performance or patient safety.
