## Dual-Purpose Remediation Technology

Researchers at the **University of Missouri** (Mizzou) have unveiled a groundbreaking approach to addressing two of the world's most pressing environmental challenges: plastic pollution and the demand for sustainable materials. In a study published this week, the engineering team demonstrated a genetically engineered strain of algae capable of filtering microplastics from aquatic environments and metabolically converting the contaminants into bioplastic precursors.

The innovation addresses the persistent issue of nanoplastics and microplastics in freshwater systems. While traditional filtration methods are often energy-intensive or ineffective against microscopic particles, this biological solution offers a low-energy, regenerative alternative.

## Engineering a Plastic-Eating Organism

The research team utilized CRISPR gene-editing technology to modify *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii*, a common freshwater algae. The modifications enhanced the algae’s ability to secrete plastic-degrading enzymes, specifically targeting polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene particles commonly found in wastewater.

Once the enzymes depolymerize the microplastics into their constituent monomers, the algae metabolizes these carbon sources. Through metabolic pathway engineering, the carbon is then diverted toward the synthesis of **Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA)**. PHAs are a family of biodegradable polyesters produced naturally by microorganisms, highly valued for their similarity to conventional plastics like polypropylene.

"We have essentially reprogrammed the algae to view pollution not as a toxin, but as a feedstock," stated the lead researcher at Mizzou Engineering. "The result is a closed-loop system where water is purified, and the waste is upcycled into a high-value biopolymer."

## Scalability and Future Applications

The lab-scale results indicate that the engineered algae can remove up to 96% of microplastic contaminants from tested water samples within 48 hours. The harvested algae biomass, now rich in intracellular PHA, can be processed to extract the bioplastic for use in packaging and medical applications.

The University of Missouri is currently exploring partnerships with municipal wastewater treatment facilities to pilot the technology in open-pond systems, marking a significant step toward scalable, biological plastic remediation.
