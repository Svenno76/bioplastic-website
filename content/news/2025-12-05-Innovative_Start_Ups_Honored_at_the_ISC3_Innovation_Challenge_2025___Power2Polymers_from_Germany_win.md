## Details
Power2Polymers, a German start-up, has been honored with the prestigious ISC3 Innovation Challenge Award 2025, winning the top prize of €15,000. The award ceremony took place at the ISC3 Investor Forum during the Impact Festival in Frankfurt on November 26-27, 2025. The company was recognized for its ground-breaking work in developing sustainable and high-performance polymer products, aligning with this year's challenge theme of "Sustainable Chemistry and Climate Change."

The core of Power2Polymers' innovation lies in its ability to integrate Polyoxymethylene (POM), a versatile yet previously inert building block, into novel polymers. This patented process allows POM to be incorporated in a liquid state, leading to enhanced performance characteristics, superior material compatibility, and a notable reduction in the product carbon footprint by up to 40%, and in some applications, up to 60% compared to conventional polypropylene glycols. Furthermore, these new polymers offer a viable and safer alternative to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," which are facing increasing regulatory scrutiny due to environmental and health concerns.

## Impact and Recognition
Power2Polymers, a spin-off from RWTH Aachen University founded in 2024, targets specialty applications such as lubricants, industrial adhesives, and coatings across various sectors, including automotive and electronics, addressing a market valued over $340 billion. Dr. Guido Schroer, founder and CEO of Power2Polymers, expressed enthusiasm for the award, highlighting the valuable visibility and networking opportunities provided by the competition. Beyond the ISC3 award, Power2Polymers also triumphed at the Impact Festival, securing the Impact Award in the Innovation category against 74 other startups.

The ISC3 Innovation Challenge showcased a diverse range of sustainable chemistry solutions. Other notable finalists included MIWA from the Czech Republic, recognized for its system to reduce plastic waste and food loss in retail, and Reverion from Germany, acknowledged for its highly efficient fuel cell-based power plants. AC Biode from Luxembourg/Japan also received a Special Impact Award for its "Plastalyst" solution, enabling low-temperature, solvent-free chemical recycling of hard-to-recycle plastics. These innovations collectively underscore the critical role of sustainable chemistry in addressing global climate challenges.
