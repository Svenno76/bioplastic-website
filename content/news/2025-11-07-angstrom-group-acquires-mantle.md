Angstrom Group has acquired Mantle, a San Francisco-based metal additive manufacturing startup, to enhance its biopolymer and bioplastics capabilities. Announced in early November 2025, this strategic acquisition aims to integrate Mantle’s advanced 3D printing technology for precision tooling into Angstrom’s global manufacturing operations. The deal supports Angstrom’s goal of accelerating innovation and efficiency in toolmaking for plastic part manufacturers across North America, South America, and Europe.

## Deal Structure

The acquisition combines Mantle’s TrueShape platform, which merges metal additive manufacturing with CNC machining, with Angstrom’s extensive production network of 41 facilities worldwide. Financial terms were not disclosed. Mantle will continue operating under its brand within the Angstrom portfolio, benefiting from increased resources to scale production capacity and expand its partner ecosystem. Angstrom plans to offer integrated design services and financing to facilitate adoption of Mantle’s technology, positioning it as a faster, cost-effective alternative to traditional moldmaking methods.

## Strategic Implications

This acquisition strengthens Angstrom’s position as a Tier 1 supplier to automotive and industrial OEMs by advancing its capabilities in biopolymers and sustainable manufacturing. Mantle’s technology is expected to drive efficiencies in tooling production, supporting reshoring trends and supply chain localization in the automotive sector. By industrializing metal 3D printing for toolmaking, Angstrom is poised to accelerate innovation in bioplastics manufacturing and meet growing demand for sustainable materials in the industry.
