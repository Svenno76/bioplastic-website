Avantium N.V., a leader in renewable and circular polymer materials, and Logoplaste Consultores Técnicos, SA, a global packaging manufacturer, announced a significant capacity reservation agreement on November 11, 2025. This agreement focuses on Avantium's plant-based, recyclable polymer PEF (polyethylene furanoate), marketed under the brand name ReLeaf®. The strategic move is designed to accelerate innovation in sustainable, high-performance packaging solutions.

## Details
Under the terms of the agreement, Logoplaste reserves future volumes of ReLeaf® from licensed plants that utilize Avantium's proprietary YXY® Technology for ReLeaf® production. This reservation supports Logoplaste's innovation pipeline for ReLeaf®-enabled packaging and anticipates increasing demand for the material upon successful completion of product validation. ReLeaf®, derived from plant-based sugars, offers circular and high-barrier performance properties, making it suitable for a wide range of packaging applications.

The collaboration extends beyond their existing partnership within The Bottle Collective, a consortium dedicated to developing recyclable fiber-based bottles. This new agreement will enable Logoplaste to integrate ReLeaf® into its core business of high-performance bottles for diverse sectors including beverages, food, pharmaceuticals, home care, and personal care. Logoplaste is renowned for its expertise in injection and blow molding technologies, delivering packaging solutions that combine durability, lightweight design, and superior barrier performance.

## Impact
This capacity reservation agreement underscores a shared commitment to driving innovation in sustainable packaging. By securing future volumes of ReLeaf®, Logoplaste can accelerate the development of advanced packaging solutions with outstanding barrier properties, aligning with customer ambitions for circularity and performance across various applications. Bineke Posthumus, Director Business Development at Avantium, expressed excitement about deepening the collaboration, noting the growing momentum behind ReLeaf® as a key material for next-generation packaging. Paulo Correia, Chief Technology Officer at Logoplaste, emphasized that the agreement is a testament to their dedication to combining renewable materials with outstanding functionality. Avantium is currently commissioning the world's first commercial-scale facility for furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), a crucial component of PEF, in Delfzijl, the Netherlands.
