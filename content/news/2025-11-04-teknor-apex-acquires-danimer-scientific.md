Teknor Apex, a global leader in plastic material science solutions, has completed the acquisition of Danimer Scientific, a prominent bioplastics company specializing in biodegradable materials. The deal, finalized in mid-2025, follows Danimer’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings earlier that year. Headquartered in Bainbridge, Georgia, Danimer operates two manufacturing and R&D facilities totaling over 200,000 square feet. This acquisition aims to enhance Teknor Apex’s sustainable materials portfolio and strengthen its position in the bioplastics market.

## Deal Structure

The acquisition was executed through a court-approved sale under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, with Teknor Apex acting as the stalking horse bidder. The $19 million deal includes Danimer’s fermentation-based production facilities, intellectual property portfolio, and related operating assets. Danimer’s extensive IP estate comprises more than 480 patents and pending applications across 20+ countries, covering fermentation-based monomer production, biopolymer compounding, and end-use applications for PHA and PLA biopolymers. Danimer will continue to operate as a separate entity under its own name and leadership team.

## Strategic Implications

This acquisition significantly expands Teknor Apex’s footprint in the sustainable materials sector by integrating Danimer’s proprietary Nodax® polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) technology, which is certified for marine and soil biodegradability. The deal accelerates Teknor Apex’s research and development capabilities and broadens its portfolio of recycled, biobased, and climate-positive solutions. It aligns with Teknor Apex’s mission to develop circular, renewable, and high-quality materials, supporting customers’ sustainability goals and advancing the bioplastics industry toward environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional plastics.
