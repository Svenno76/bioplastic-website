Copenhagen-based synthetic biology innovator Octarine Bio has successfully closed a €5 million funding round aimed at accelerating the commercial scaling of its proprietary bio-based pigment platform. This capital injection marks a critical step in the company’s mission to replace petrochemical-derived dyes and colorants with safe, sustainable alternatives derived through precision fermentation.

## Scaling Precision Fermentation

The textile and packaging industries have long struggled with the environmental footprint of coloration. Conventional synthetic dyes often rely on heavy metals and toxic mordants, posing significant challenges to wastewater management and material recyclability. Octarine Bio utilizes enzymatic engineering and fermentation processes to produce nature-identical pigments.

This fresh injection of €5 million will enable the company to transition from pilot-scale operations to industrial production capabilities. By leveraging engineered yeast strains, Octarine Bio produces vibrant colors—such as their flagship violacein derivatives—without the need for hazardous chemicals or extensive land use associated with agricultural dye crops.

## Solving the Additive Challenge

While significant strides have been made in developing biopolymers like PLA and PHA, the additives used to color them often remain fossil-based or toxic, potentially compromising the compostability or recyclability of the final product.

Octarine Bio’s technology addresses this "additive gap" in the bio-economy. Their bio-based pigments are designed to be compatible with various substrates, including natural fibers and bioplastics, ensuring that the coloring process does not negate the sustainable credentials of the base material. The funding will support further R&D to optimize these pigments for broader material applications, ensuring stability and vibrancy in commercial packaging and textile products.

With regulatory pressure mounting on chemical usage in consumer goods, Octarine Bio is positioning itself as a key supply chain partner for brands seeking a holistic approach to sustainable material design.
