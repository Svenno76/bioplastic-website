Honeywell successfully completed the spin-off of its Advanced Materials business, now operating as Solstice Advanced Materials, on October 30, 2025. This strategic move is part of Honeywell's broader plan to establish three independent, focused market-leading companies, with further separations for its Automation and Aerospace businesses slated for the second half of 2026. Solstice Advanced Materials officially began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol "SOLS".

Solstice Advanced Materials emerges as a leading global specialty materials company, building on a heritage spanning over 130 years in advanced materials science. The company is dedicated to delivering high-performance solutions across diverse critical industries. Its business is structured into two main segments: Refrigerants & Applied Solutions, which accounts for approximately 72% of its net sales, and Electronic & Specialty Materials, making up the remaining 28%. Solstice's product portfolio includes essential items such as refrigerants, advanced materials for semiconductor manufacturing, protective fibers, and healthcare packaging. In 2024, the assets now comprising Solstice generated approximately $3.8 billion in net sales and employed nearly 4,000 individuals worldwide. The spin-off aims to allow Solstice to pursue its own growth strategies and allocate capital more efficiently as an independent, publicly traded entity.
