Kemvera, the low-carbon chemical technology firm formerly known as New Iridium, has reached a critical infrastructure milestone with the completion of the design package for its first commercial-scale manufacturing plant. The facility is designed to produce bio-acetic acid and bio-ethyl acetate, marking a significant transition from pilot-stage development to industrial chemical production.

## Engineering a Carbon-Negative Future

The completion of the process design package represents the final step before the commencement of Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) phases. Kemvera’s proprietary technology utilizes a photocatalytic process that activates chemical bonds using light rather than heat, significantly lowering the energy intensity required for production.

The new plant design focuses on the production of bio-acetic acid, a ubiquitous chemical building block used in the manufacturing of paints, adhesives, and biopolymers, as well as bio-ethyl acetate, a widely used environmentally friendly solvent. By utilizing bio-based feedstocks and their light-driven catalysis platform, Kemvera aims to deliver these commodity chemicals with a substantially reduced carbon footprint compared to traditional petrochemical routes.

## Supply Chain Decarbonization

The commercialization of bio-acetic acid is particularly relevant for the bioplastics sector. Acetic acid is a key precursor for materials such as cellulose acetate and polyvinyl acetate (PVA). As global brands seek to reduce Scope 3 emissions, the availability of cost-competitive, drop-in bio-based alternatives for these foundational chemicals is essential.

Kemvera’s advancement signals readiness to supply the market with materials that maintain the performance standards of fossil-based equivalents while offering verifiable carbon reductions. This design completion validates the scalability of the company's photocatalysis platform, positioning Kemvera to meet growing demand for sustainable chemical intermediates in 2026 and beyond.
