Braskem has officially expanded its Renewable Innovation Center in Lexington, Massachusetts, reinforcing its commitment to advancing sustainable materials. The $20 million facility, opened in 2024, aims to accelerate research and development in renewable chemicals and biopolymers. Strategically located in the Greater Boston area, the center leverages proximity to over 60 universities and a vibrant biotech ecosystem to drive innovation in plant-based materials and support Braskem’s goal of producing 1 million tons of bioproducts annually by 2030.

## Facility Details

The 35,000-square-foot Renewable Innovation Center enhances Braskem’s capabilities in biotechnology, catalysis, and process engineering, focusing on converting biomass feedstocks such as sugars, cellulose, plant oils, and lignin into sustainable chemicals and materials. The center supports early-stage science and engineering efforts, including genetic engineering of bacteria to develop new biopolymer production methods. It complements Braskem’s global R&D network spanning the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, and Germany, and is led by Daniel MacEachran, Global Head of Biotechnology.

## Market Impact

Braskem’s expansion positions the company as a leader in the bioplastics industry, driving the transition to a carbon-neutral circular economy. The center’s innovations are expected to underpin new bio-based products, including polyethylene and polypropylene, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. This initiative aligns with global sustainability trends and supports Braskem’s ambition to capture significant market share in renewable polymers by 2030, contributing to climate change mitigation and advancing the broader adoption of sustainable packaging and materials.
