TotalEnergies Corbion, a global leader in bioplastics, is advancing its position in the sustainable materials market through strategic innovations in polylactic acid (PLA) technology and chemical recycling infrastructure. The company, a 50/50 joint venture between TotalEnergies and Corbion headquartered in the Netherlands, continues to expand its Luminy® PLA portfolio across multiple industries, from packaging to automotive applications. With production capacity of 75,000 tons annually at its Rayong, Thailand facility and plans for a 100,000-ton facility in Grandpuits, France, TotalEnergies Corbion is positioning itself as a key enabler of the circular economy transition.

## Background

TotalEnergies Corbion has achieved significant milestones in PLA commercialization and recycling. The company operates an advanced hydrolysis process at its Thailand facility, producing recycled PLA (rPLA) in two grades—30% and 100% recycled content. Recently, the company announced partnerships with Useon to develop EPLA (Expanded PLA) foam technology, offering plant-based alternatives to fossil-based expanded polystyrene. Additionally, collaborations with Benvic have expanded low-carbon PLA compounds for automotive and electronics applications.

## Significance

These innovations address critical industry demands for sustainable alternatives to conventional plastics. TotalEnergies Corbion's chemical recycling capabilities demonstrate commercial viability of large-scale PLA recycling, supporting the Global Plastics Treaty's circular economy objectives. By combining biobased origins with industrial compostability and recyclability, the company is establishing PLA as a fully circular material, positioning itself to capture growing market demand in the bioplastics sector expanding at over 20% annually.
