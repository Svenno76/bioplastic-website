Plastipak Holdings, Inc., a global leader in the design and manufacture of rigid plastic containers, has officially unveiled the Plastipak Processing Lab in partnership with Michigan State University (MSU). Located within the university's School of Packaging, this newly inaugurated facility represents a significant investment in the infrastructure required to advance polymer science and sustainable manufacturing education.

## Bridging Industry and Academia
The Plastipak Processing Lab is designed to eliminate the gap between theoretical coursework and real-world industrial application. The facility is equipped with state-of-the-art processing machinery that mirrors the high-speed equipment utilized in Plastipak’s global manufacturing centers. This setup allows students to gain critical hands-on experience with injection molding, blow molding, and the analysis of polymer behavior under thermal processing conditions. By training on industry-standard technology, MSU students are being prepared to tackle complex challenges in material efficiency and circular design immediately upon entering the workforce.

## Accelerating Sustainable Material Research
Beyond workforce development, the lab serves as a vital hub for research into next-generation materials. With the packaging sector moving aggressively toward circular models, the facility will facilitate advanced testing of post-consumer recycled (PCR) resins and emerging bio-based polymer formulations.

The processing capabilities allow researchers to simulate high-volume production cycles, analyzing how alternative materials perform compared to virgin petrochemical resins. This data is essential for validating the commercial viability of bioplastics and high-content rPET containers, ensuring that sustainable alternatives maintain necessary structural integrity and barrier properties. This collaboration underscores Plastipak’s commitment to driving innovation through academic partnership, ensuring the next generation of packaging engineers is equipped to lead the transition to a lower-carbon economy.
