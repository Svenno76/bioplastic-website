## Details
P2 Science, a leader in green chemistry, and Algenesis Corporation, specializing in bio-based and biodegradable polyurethanes, announced a strategic collaboration on November 12, 2025, to advance and commercialize raw materials for 100% biobased polyurethane products. The partnership aims to establish a new, sustainable chemical and polymer supply chain to replace petroleum-based plastics and mitigate microplastic pollution.

P2 Science will leverage its proprietary Process Intensified Ozonolysis (PIOz™) technology to convert oils derived from algae feedstocks into algae-based azelaic acid at its Naugatuck, Connecticut manufacturing site. Azelaic acid is a crucial chemical intermediate for producing polymers and isocyanates. Algenesis will then utilize this algae-based azelaic acid in its recently commissioned Bio-Iso™ pilot plant and advanced biobased polyurethane platforms to create 100% bio-polyurethanes.

## Impact
This collaboration is set to deliver high-performance, biodegradable polyurethanes that do not rely on petrochemical content or toxic phosgene, expanding sustainable solutions for a variety of applications. The target applications include footwear, apparel, coatings, adhesives, and consumer products. Both companies are committed to scaling the production of their respective materials, making plant-based chemicals and bio-polyurethanes widely available to the market.

Oihana Elizalde, CEO of P2 Science, emphasized that the partnership accelerates their shared vision to eliminate petroleum-based carbon from everyday materials, offering brands a measurable sustainability advantage without compromising performance. Similarly, Steve Mayfield, CEO of Algenesis, stated their mission is to replace traditional plastics with plant-based materials that safely degrade at the end of life, ensuring a cleaner, healthier planet. This initiative directly addresses the global transition towards eliminating microplastics from commerce and the environment.
