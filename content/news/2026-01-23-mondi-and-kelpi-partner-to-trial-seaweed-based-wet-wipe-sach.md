Global packaging and paper leader Mondi has announced a strategic collaboration with sustainable material innovator Kelpi to prototype and trial a new generation of wet wipe sachets. The partnership aims to eliminate the fossil-fuel-based plastic liners traditionally used in composite packaging, replacing them with Kelpi’s proprietary seaweed-derived coating technology.

## Scaling Regenerative Packaging

The collaboration leverages Mondi’s extensive manufacturing capabilities and market reach with Kelpi’s cutting-edge biomaterial science. Standard wet wipe sachets are typically composed of a laminate structure involving plastic, aluminum, and paper, making them difficult to recycle and a significant contributor to landfill waste. By utilizing Kelpi’s renewable biopolymer coating, the companies aim to produce a sachet that is not only plastic-free but also capable of entering standard paper recycling streams or composting at end-of-life.

## Overcoming the Moisture Barrier Challenge

Wet wipe packaging represents a notorious technical challenge in the bioplastics sector. The packaging must maintain a robust barrier to contain moisture, alcohol, and essential oils over extended shelf lives—properties that usually degrade bio-based materials rapidly.

Kelpi’s innovation utilizes the unique molecular structure of seaweed to create a high-performance barrier that matches the water and grease resistance of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). When applied to Mondi’s functional kraft paper, the coating ensures the integrity of the wet wipe without persisting in the environment. The seaweed feedstock is ethically sourced and requires no fertilizers, fresh water, or arable land to grow, ensuring a low carbon footprint.

## Future-Proofing for 2026 Regulations

This trial comes as the packaging industry faces tightening regulations regarding single-use plastics in the EU and UK. "Combining Mondi's expertise in paper conversion with Kelpi's breakthrough barrier technology allows us to tackle applications previously thought unsuitable for fiber-based packaging," a spokesperson for the project noted.

Successful trials will focus on "runability" on existing filling lines, ensuring that brands can switch to this marine-safe alternative without significant capital expenditure on new machinery. If the pilot meets performance metrics, the solution could be rolled out to personal care and cosmetic brands globally later this year.
