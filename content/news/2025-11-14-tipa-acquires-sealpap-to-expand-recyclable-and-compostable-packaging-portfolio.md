TIPA Compostable Packaging, a leader in flexible compostable solutions, has acquired Sealpap, a Dutch specialist in recyclable paper-based packaging, through its European subsidiary Bio4Pack. Announced on November 14, 2025, the deal combines TIPA's certified compostable technologies with Sealpap's sealable coated papers—used in sachets, rice packs, and airline wraps—to help global brands meet product needs, environmental targets, and stringent EU regulations. This move advances TIPA's mission to drive circular packaging innovation across Europe and North America.

## Deal Structure

The acquisition integrates Sealpap's Netherlands-based operations, producing recyclable papers from virgin and FSC-certified recycled sources compatible with standard packaging machines. TIPA and Bio4Pack aim to scale production at Sealpap's Dutch facility by 40% by mid-2026, enhancing output for high-performance flexible packaging. No financial terms were disclosed, but executives emphasized seamless synergy: TIPA CEO Daphna Nissenbaum highlighted portfolio expansion for customer demands, while Sealpap owner Robert van der Laan noted combined expertise in compostability and coated papers.

## Strategic Implications

This merger bolsters the bioplastics sector by offering brands dual pathways—recyclable and compostable—amid tightening EU packaging laws and rising consumer demand for circular solutions. TIPA's growth strategy, including prior partnerships with Coveris and Presto for compostable zippers, positions it as a frontrunner, enabling scalable, regulation-compliant innovations that decompose like organic waste or recycle efficiently. Industry observers see it accelerating the shift from single-use plastics, fostering sustainability in food, pharma, and beyond.
