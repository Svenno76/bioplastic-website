## Details
Blue Ocean Closures (BOC), a Swedish innovation company, has achieved a significant milestone with its latest generation of fibre screw caps. The company announced on November 5, 2025, that these caps are now on track to match or even outperform fossil plastic in material cost, while simultaneously requiring up to 90% less energy for production. This breakthrough stems from continuous advancements in BOC's proprietary forming technology, which enables the high-volume production of three-dimensional fibre components directly from new or recycled paperboard.

The manufacturing process boasts impressive efficiency, with cycle times under two seconds and an energy demand that is roughly one-tenth of traditional plastic injection molding. According to Lars Sandberg, CEO of Blue Ocean Closures, this development represents a pivotal moment where sustainability aligns with profitability, making fibre-based closures a cost-leading, low-carbon alternative for various packaging applications. The caps are designed to be fully recyclable, integrating seamlessly into existing paper and board recycling systems.

## Impact
This advancement by Blue Ocean Closures holds substantial implications for the packaging industry, particularly in high-volume segments like liquid cartons, which currently utilize billions of plastic caps annually. By offering a viable, cost-competitive, and environmentally superior alternative, BOC provides a direct pathway towards circular packaging solutions without compromising functionality or design. The shift is also supported by accelerating demand for sustainable packaging, driven by global brand commitments and new EU regulations.

Beyond the environmental and economic benefits, the fibre-based screw caps also offer new branding opportunities. Their natural appearance, tactile feel, and customizable geometry provide strong shelf impact and consumer appeal, allowing brands to differentiate their products through both design and sustainability. Blue Ocean Closures has already demonstrated the commercial viability of its product through collaborations with early adopters and global brands, including Great Earth, who have successfully implemented the fibre caps for their supplement products.
