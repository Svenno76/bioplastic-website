Henkel, a global leader in adhesive technologies, has entered into a strategic partnership with Swedish chemical company Sekab to integrate bio-based raw materials into its product formulations. This collaboration marks a significant step forward in the adhesive industry’s transition away from fossil-based feedstocks, aiming to deliver high-performance bonding solutions with a reduced carbon footprint.

## Scaling Bio-Based Intermediates

The partnership focuses on utilizing Sekab’s expertise in producing green chemicals derived from renewable biomass. As the demand for sustainable industrial consumables grows, the adhesive sector faces the challenge of replacing petrochemical-derived acrylates and additives without compromising bond strength or durability.

Sekab will supply Henkel with bio-based intermediates, likely derived from their sustainable ethanol production platform. These raw materials serve as the building blocks for high-quality adhesive polymers. By leveraging Sekab’s technology, Henkel aims to substitute fossil-based ingredients in their supply chain while maintaining the technical specifications required for applications ranging from packaging to automotive assembly.

## Driving Decarbonization in Adhesives

This initiative is part of a broader trend in the chemical industry to address Scope 3 emissions—those associated with the upstream production of raw materials. By incorporating renewable feedstocks, Henkel is positioning itself to offer customers quantifiable reductions in CO2 emissions.

“Shaping the future with bio-based raw materials is not just about substitution; it is about proving that sustainability does not require a trade-off in performance,” the companies indicated regarding the venture. The move aligns with the European chemical sector’s aggressive 2030 and 2050 climate targets, validating the commercial viability of bio-based supply chains in complex chemical formulations.
