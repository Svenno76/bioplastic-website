## A New Benchmark in Renewable Chemistry

**AMSTERDAM** – Avantium N.V., a leading pioneer in the emerging renewable chemistry sector, announced today that its commercial-scale FDCA (furandicarboxylic acid) flagship plant in Delfzijl, the Netherlands, has officially been awarded a triple ISO certification. This prestigious recognition includes ISO 9001:2015 (Quality Management), ISO 14001:2015 (Environmental Management), and ISO 45001:2018 (Occupational Health and Safety).

The achievement marks a significant transition for the company, moving from the research and development phase into high-standard commercial manufacturing. By securing all three certifications simultaneously, Avantium demonstrates that its "YXY" technology—which converts plant-based sugars into FDCA—is not only innovative but meets the world’s most rigorous industrial standards for safety, environmental responsibility, and product consistency.

## Strengthening the PEF Value Chain

FDCA is the essential building block for PEF (polyethylene furanoate), a 100% plant-based and fully recyclable plastic. PEF has gained significant traction among global brands due to its superior barrier properties, which keep carbonated drinks and food products fresher for longer than traditional petroleum-based PET.

"This triple certification is a testament to our team’s dedication to excellence as we scale our operations," said a spokesperson for Avantium. "It provides our partners and stakeholders with the ultimate assurance that our flagship plant operates with a 'safety first' culture and a deep commitment to minimizing our ecological footprint."

## Driving the Circular Economy

As global regulations on single-use plastics tighten, the Delfzijl facility serves as a blueprint for the future of the circular economy. The ISO 14001 certification specifically highlights Avantium’s success in integrating sustainable practices into its daily operations, ensuring that the production of bio-based materials does not come at the cost of environmental health.

With these certifications in place, Avantium is well-positioned to accelerate the commercial roll-out of PEF, offering a viable, high-performance alternative to fossil-fuel-based plastics on the global stage.
