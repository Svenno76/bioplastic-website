Corbion has announced a strategic partnership with Nestlé to co-develop PHA-based barrier materials for shelf-stable, compostable food packaging. This collaboration, rooted in the Netherlands and targeting global markets, aims to advance circular packaging systems and support both companies’ sustainability commitments. The initiative leverages Corbion’s expertise in biopolymers and Nestlé’s leadership in sustainable food solutions.

## Collaboration Details

The partnership will focus on creating high-performance PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) barrier materials designed to replace conventional plastics in food packaging. These materials will be tailored for shelf-stable products, ensuring compostability without compromising on functionality. Corbion’s biopolymer technology, combined with Nestlé’s packaging innovation capabilities, will drive the development and commercialization of these next-generation solutions. The collaboration is expected to accelerate the adoption of compostable packaging across Nestlé’s global product portfolio.

## Expected Outcomes

This initiative is poised to set new benchmarks in the bioplastics industry by demonstrating scalable, compostable packaging solutions for mainstream food applications. By advancing PHA-based materials, Corbion and Nestlé are addressing critical challenges in packaging sustainability, including end-of-life management and circularity. The partnership is expected to catalyze broader industry adoption of biopolymers, supporting the transition toward a more sustainable and circular packaging ecosystem.
