**BASF Debuts World's First Biomass-Balanced Polyethersulfone**

BASF has launched **Ultrason E 2010 BMB**, the world's first biomass-balanced polyethersulfone (PESU), marking a significant advancement in sustainable high-performance plastics. Announced in March 2025, the innovative material incorporates 39% bio-attributed feedstock derived from organic waste, enabling manufacturers across automotive, electronics, healthcare, and consumer goods sectors to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing performance or requiring new processing equipment.

## Product Innovation

The biomass-balanced approach replaces 50% of fossil raw materials with ISCC PLUS-certified bio-circular feedstocks at the production stage. Using a mass balance methodology, the renewable content is mathematically allocated to the final product, resulting in a lower product carbon footprint compared to standard BASF materials. Production at BASF's Ludwigshafen, Germany facility utilizes 100% green electricity in a resource-efficient process, further reducing environmental impact while maintaining the material's superior mechanical properties and thermal stability.

## Applications and Industry Impact

Ultrason E 2010 BMB enables manufacturers in diverse industries—from household appliances to automotive components—to differentiate products while advancing sustainability goals. As a drop-in replacement for conventional polyethersulfone, the material requires no investment in new processing infrastructure, accelerating adoption across supply chains. This launch represents BASF's strategic shift toward commercializing high-performance biomass-balanced polymers, following successful scaling of foundational products like Ultraform POM plastics. The achievement demonstrates how mass balance technology can deliver circular solutions at scale, positioning BASF as a leader in the sustainable materials transformation.
