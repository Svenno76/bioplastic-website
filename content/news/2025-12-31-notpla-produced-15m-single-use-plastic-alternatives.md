London-based sustainable packaging company **Notpla** has announced it produced 15 million single-use plastic alternatives in 2025, marking significant growth in its seaweed-based biopolymer manufacturing capabilities. This milestone represents a substantial increase from 11.4 million units in 2024 and 4.4 million in 2023, demonstrating accelerating market adoption of marine-safe packaging solutions. The achievement underscores Notpla's position as a leading innovator in the emerging seaweed biopolymers sector.

## Financial Performance

Notpla's production surge reflects robust investor confidence in seaweed-based alternatives. The company secured $26.8 million in funding during 2024, establishing itself as the primary beneficiary of capital flowing into the biopolymer space. This financial momentum continued into 2025, enabling scaled manufacturing operations. The production growth trajectory—tripling output year-over-year—indicates successful commercialization of seaweed film technology developed through the Tom Ford Plastic Innovation Accelerator, where Notpla earned recognition alongside competitors Sway and Zerocircle.

## Outlook

Notpla's expansion signals broader industry momentum toward marine-derived packaging solutions. The company has already replaced 21.5 million single-use plastics and targets 100 million replacements, positioning seaweed biopolymers as viable alternatives to conventional fossil-based packaging. With partnerships expanding across foodservice and e-commerce sectors, and recent recognition including a 2025 Pentawards Silver for Supplier Innovation, Notpla's growth trajectory suggests seaweed-based packaging is transitioning from niche innovation to mainstream adoption, potentially reshaping sustainable packaging markets globally.
