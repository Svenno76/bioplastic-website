**BRUSSELS** — Plastics Recyclers Europe (PRE) has officially released an extensive mapping of recycling technologies across the continent, providing a critical snapshot of the industry’s infrastructure as the European Union approaches its aggressive 2030 waste diversion targets. The new data offers a granular look at the installed capacities for both mechanical and chemical recycling, highlighting significant regional shifts in processing capabilities.

## Benchmarking European Capacity

The 2026 report indicates a robust increase in total installed recycling capacity compared to 2024 figures. The mapping project identifies over 850 active recycling sites, segmenting them by the specific polymer streams processed, including PET, polyolefins (PO), and PVC, as well as emerging streams.

According to the data, mechanical recycling remains the backbone of Europe's circular economy, accounting for the vast majority of installed capacity. However, the map reveals a strategic expansion in advanced mechanical recycling lines equipped with high-efficiency washing and super-cleaning technologies, particularly for food-contact applications.

## Technological Diversification

A key finding in the 2026 analysis is the integration of diverse recycling technologies to handle complex waste streams. While mechanical recycling dominates rigid plastics, the map highlights a growing footprint for physical and chemical recycling technologies designed to tackle difficult-to-recycle films and mixed plastic waste.

The data underscores the industry's response to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), showing a marked increase in sorting facilities utilizing advanced Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. These upgrades are essential for distinguishing between conventional fossil-based polymers and an increasing volume of drop-in bioplastics, ensuring that bio-based PE and PET are effectively captured within existing streams without compromising recyclate quality.

## Closing the Loop

"Transparency in recycling capacity is a prerequisite for a truly circular Europe," a PRE spokesperson stated regarding the release. The map serves not only as a market analysis tool but also as a strategic guide for investors and policymakers to identify infrastructure gaps. The report suggests that while Northern and Western Europe maintain high density in processing plants, Southern and Eastern regions are accelerating their investment in flexible plastic recycling lines to meet the EU’s harmonized collection mandates.
