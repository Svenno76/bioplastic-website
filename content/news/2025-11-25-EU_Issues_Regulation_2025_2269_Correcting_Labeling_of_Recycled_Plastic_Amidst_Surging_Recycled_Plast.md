The European Union has issued Commission Regulation (EU) 2025/2269 on November 12, 2025, to address and correct specific provisions within its existing framework for recycled plastic. This new regulation primarily rectifies Regulation (EU) 2022/1616, which governs the labeling of recycled plastic, the development of recycling technologies, and the transfer of authorizations, particularly for food contact materials. The corrections aim to clarify ambiguities and ensure consistent application by economic operators involved in the recycled plastics value chain. The regulation is slated to enter into force on December 3, 2025.

## Details of the Regulation

Regulation (EU) 2025/2269 specifically amends key articles of Regulation (EU) 2022/1616. For instance, it modifies Article 4 to ensure that recycled plastic materials and articles are only placed on the market when all specified requirements during their manufacture are met, including those outlined in paragraph 8 of the original regulation. Furthermore, Article 5 is updated to clarify labeling requirements for recycled plastic delivered to converters, mandating the application of the symbol defined in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004. These adjustments are critical for maintaining high standards in recycled plastic products, especially those intended for food contact.

## Market Context and Impact

The timing of this regulatory correction coincides with a robust expansion of the global recycled plastics market. According to projections by Towards Chemical and Materials Consulting, the market is expected to surge from USD 86.11 billion in 2025 to a remarkable USD 190.25 billion by 2035, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.25% from 2026 to 2035. A significant driver for this growth is the escalating demand for sustainable automotive interior components. The automotive sector increasingly incorporates recycled plastics into both interior and exterior parts, aligning with sustainability objectives, lightweighting initiatives, and cost efficiencies. Europe, in particular, is witnessing rapid growth in this market, propelled by its stringent environmental regulations and ambitious circular economy policies. This regulatory clarity from the EU Commission is crucial for fostering confidence and investment in a rapidly evolving market focused on circularity.
