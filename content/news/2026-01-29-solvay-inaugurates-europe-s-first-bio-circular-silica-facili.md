Solvay has officially inaugurated its highly anticipated bio-circular silica production facility in Livorno, Italy, establishing the site as the first of its kind in Europe. The new plant represents a significant technological leap in the production of highly dispersible silica (HDS), a critical reinforcing agent used primarily in the automotive tire industry.

## A Milestone for Circular Chemistry

The Livorno facility utilizes a proprietary process to produce silica from rice husk ash (RHA), an agricultural by-product that is typically landfilled or incinerated. By valorizing this silicate-rich waste stream, Solvay replaces the traditional energy-intensive method of manufacturing silica, which involves melting sand at high temperatures.

According to Solvay, this bio-circular approach significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the production process. The integration of RHA allows for a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions per ton of silica produced compared to conventional methods, aligning with the growing demand for circular raw materials in the chemical sector.

## From Agricultural Waste to High-Performance Tires

The primary application for this bio-circular silica is the manufacturing of high-performance, energy-efficient tires. Highly dispersible silica is essential for reducing the rolling resistance of tires, which in turn improves a vehicle's fuel economy and reduces battery consumption in electric vehicles.

By sourcing the silica from renewable bio-based feedstocks, Solvay enables tire manufacturers to increase the sustainable content of their products without compromising on performance, durability, or safety.

## Advancing Carbon Neutrality

This investment underscores Solvay’s broader sustainability roadmap, which aims to phase out fossil-based raw materials and reduce Scope 3 emissions. The Livorno plant serves as a scalable model for future bio-circular projects, demonstrating that industrial performance and environmental stewardship can coexist within the complex supply chains of the automotive and rubber industries.
