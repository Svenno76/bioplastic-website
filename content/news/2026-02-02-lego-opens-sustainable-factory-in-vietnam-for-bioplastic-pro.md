The Lego Group has officially inaugurated its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Binh Duong province, Vietnam, marking a critical milestone in the company’s transition toward sustainable materials. The $1 billion investment is Lego's first carbon-neutral run factory and is positioned to serve as the primary production hub for the Asia-Pacific region, drastically reducing shipping-related emissions.

## Scaling Bio-Based Manufacturing

The Vietnam facility is specifically engineered to handle the processing complexities of next-generation sustainable polymers. While Lego has utilized bio-polyethylene (Bio-PE) derived from sugarcane for its softer elements—such as trees and bushes—since 2018, this new plant is equipped to scale the production of harder structural bricks using bio-attributed materials.

Moving away from fossil-fuel-based ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene), the factory utilizes mass-balance certified materials that integrate renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil and renewable e-methanol. The molding machinery at the Binh Duong site features advanced temperature control systems designed to maintain the structural integrity and clutch power of these newer bioplastic formulations, ensuring they match the durability of traditional bricks.

## Net-Zero Energy Infrastructure

Beyond the materials produced, the factory’s operation sets a new industry standard for energy efficiency. The site is powered by a rooftop solar array and a neighboring solar farm, generating enough renewable energy to match 100% of the facility's annual consumption. The plant also employs smart grid technology to optimize energy use during the high-heat injection molding process.

By locating production closer to key markets in China and Southeast Asia, the Lego Group anticipates a significant reduction in its scope 3 carbon emissions. This opening keeps the company on track for its pledge to use sustainable materials in all products by 2032.
