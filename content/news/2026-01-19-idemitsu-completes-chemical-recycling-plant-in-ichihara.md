Japanese petrochemical giant Idemitsu Kosan has officially announced the completion of its new chemical recycling facility located within the Chiba Complex in Ichihara City. This milestone marks a significant step in the company's transition toward a circular business model, enabling the commercial-scale conversion of waste plastics into renewable feedstock.

## Advancing Circular Infrastructure

The newly completed plant utilizes advanced pyrolysis technology to process used plastics—specifically those difficult to recycle through traditional mechanical methods. By reverting these plastics into a chemically recycled oil, the facility provides a raw material substitute for conventional fossil-based naphtha. This oil will be fed into Idemitsu’s existing crackers to produce basic chemicals and new plastic resins, effectively closing the loop on plastic waste.

Idemitsu has positioned this facility as a cornerstone of its "CNX Center" (Carbon Neutral Transformation) initiative. By integrating chemical recycling directly into its existing refining infrastructure in Chiba, the company aims to streamline the production of certified circular polymers using the mass balance approach.

## Reducing Reliance on Fossil Resources

The Ichihara plant addresses a critical gap in Japan’s waste management infrastructure. Historically, a significant portion of mixed plastic waste in the region has been subjected to thermal recovery (incineration) due to contamination or material complexity. Idemitsu’s chemical recycling process breaks down these polymer chains, allowing mixed and multi-layer plastics to be reclaimed as virgin-quality grade materials.

This development aligns with the company's broader roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Idemitsu plans to progressively increase the processing capacity of the site and expand the procurement of waste plastic feedstock through municipal and industrial partnerships. Commercial operations are expected to ramp up immediately following the final commissioning phase, supplying the market with sustainable olefins and derivatives later this year.
