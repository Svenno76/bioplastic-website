## Details
BIOWEG, a German-based innovator in sustainable biomaterials, successfully closed its Series A funding round, securing an impressive €16 million. This substantial investment was led by Axeleo Capital's Green Tech Industry Fund, with additional participation from the EIC Fund, NBank Capital, BonVenture, and seed investor Dr.-Ing. Frank Jenner. This latest funding brings BIOWEG's total capital raised to date to €22 million, aimed at accelerating market entry and expanding its footprint across Europe.

Founded in 2019 by Dr. Prateek Mahalwar and Srinivas Karuturi, BIOWEG utilizes precision fermentation to convert food-industry byproducts, such as sugar side streams, into bacterial cellulose. This bacterial cellulose is then refined using green chemistry to create high-performance, biodegradable alternatives to fossil-based polymers and intentionally added acrylic polymer-based microplastics. The company currently operates a pilot production facility in Quakenbrück with a capacity of up to six tonnes and a material science, formulation, and applications lab on Bayer Crop Science's campus in Monheim.

## Impact
The €16 million Series A funding is earmarked for critical scale-up, commercialization, and the construction of BIOWEG's first industrial-scale bacterial cellulose production plant in Germany. This new facility will significantly expand the company's fermentation capacity, designed to meet the growing demand for sustainable, microplastics-free ingredients. Strategically, the plant will be co-located with a major sugar producer in Germany, enabling feedstock synergies and reducing operating costs.

BIOWEG's technology directly addresses the global microplastic crisis and aligns with stringent European regulations. The EU is progressively phasing out intentionally added fossil-based microplastics across various sectors, with bans starting as early as 2027 for rinse-off cosmetics and extending to detergents, fertilizers, and other products by 2035. BIOWEG's product portfolio includes MicBeads, a biodegradable replacement for plastic microbeads in cosmetics; Rheoweg, a bio-based rheology modifier for home and personal care; and Agriweg, a solution for seed coatings and fertilizer encapsulation in agriculture. Co-founder and CEO, Dr. Prateek Mahalwar, emphasized that this funding allows BIOWEG to "move decisively into industrial manufacturing and to support customers as they transition away from microplastics."
