## Details of the Acquisition

Agilyx ASA, a leading chemical recycling company focused on developing plastic waste feedstock supply, officially completed its acquisition of a 44% equity stake in GreenDot Global S.à r.l. on October 15, 2025. This transformative investment, initially announced in July 2025, sees Agilyx contribute EUR 7 million to a larger EUR 27 million investment round into GreenDot, as part of a total consideration of EUR 52 million for the 44% stake. The transaction solidifies Agilyx's strategic presence in the European market.

GreenDot Global is recognized as Europe's leading circular plastic recycling platform and the third-largest recycling company in Germany. The company operates across 29 countries, processing over 1 million tons of packaging waste annually, including more than 400,000 tons of plastic.

## Strategic Impact and Expansion

This acquisition significantly enhances Agilyx's global platform for sourcing and supplying feedstock to the advanced recycling industry. Agilyx CEO Ranjeet Bhatia highlighted the opportunity to rapidly build a leading pan-European plastic recycling platform, leveraging GreenDot's strong position and momentum in the advanced recycling market.

GreenDot, under the new capital injection, is set to further expand its facilities in Germany, Austria, and Italy. This expansion includes investments in new sorting facilities to enhance feedstock supply capabilities for advanced recycling. GreenDot has already secured a 10-year feedstock supply contract from a third-party advanced recycling facility, projected to handle 20,000-34,000 tons per annum. Furthermore, the company has entered an agreement to acquire a mechanical recycling facility in Italy, specializing in bottle-to-bottle recycling and the production of pipes from recycled materials. Laurent Auguste, CEO of GreenDot, emphasized that the synergies created by this investment will strengthen their ability to partner with global brands in the plastic packaging value chain.
