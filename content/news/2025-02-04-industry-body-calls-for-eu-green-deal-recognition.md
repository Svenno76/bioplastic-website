European Bioplastics (EUBP), the association representing the interests of the bioplastics industry across Europe, has issued a formal call to action urging European Union policymakers to integrate the bioplastics sector more deeply into the legislative framework of the European Green Deal. The organization argues that achieving a truly circular economy and climate neutrality by 2050 is impossible without a strategic shift away from fossil-based materials toward bio-based and compostable alternatives.

## Decoupling from Fossil Resources

In its latest communication, EUBP emphasized that the EU’s industrial transformation requires a fundamental change in feedstock sourcing. The association highlights that bio-based plastics play a pivotal role in decoupling plastic production from fossil resources. By utilizing renewable biomass, the industry can sequester atmospheric carbon in products, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of the plastics value chain.

EUBP stresses that legislative support is required to incentivize the uptake of bio-based materials. They argue that the current regulatory landscape often fails to distinguish adequately between fossil-based plastics and those derived from renewable resources, hindering the market penetration of low-carbon alternatives that offer identical technical performance.

## The Role of Compostable Plastics

The call to action also spotlights the specific utility of certified compostable plastics in closing the loop on organic waste. EUBP advocates for regulations that acknowledge compostable packaging as a key tool for increasing the collection of bio-waste. When used in specific applications—such as tea bags, coffee capsules, and fruit labels—industrially compostable plastics facilitate the diversion of food scraps from landfills and incineration to organic recycling streams, producing valuable compost and soil improvers.

## Creating a Stable Investment Environment

The association warns that without clear recognition and a supportive policy framework, Europe risks stalling innovation in the sector. EUBP calls for a consistent regulatory environment that provides planning security for investors and manufacturers. By officially recognizing the bioplastics industry as an enabler of the Green Deal, the EU can unlock necessary investments in local production capacities and research, ensuring Europe remains a leader in sustainable material science.
