Reju, a company specializing in textile-to-textile regeneration, has officially selected New York as the site for its first recycling plant in the United States. This announcement marks a significant expansion for the company, signaling its entry into the North American market to address the growing crisis of textile waste.

## Bridging the Circular Gap
The planned New York facility will focus on converting post-consumer polyester textiles—often deemed unrecyclable by traditional mechanical methods—back into virgin-quality material. Utilizing advanced regeneration technology, the plant will process hard-to-recycle waste, including mixed blends, to produce circular polyester (rPET) suitable for the fashion and apparel industries.

Unlike mechanical recycling, which can degrade the quality of the polymer over time, Reju’s process depolymerizes the plastic waste. This chemical separation allows for the removal of dyes and impurities, resulting in a raw material that maintains the performance characteristics of fossil-based polyester, but with a significantly lower carbon footprint.

## Strategic Location for Sustainable Fashion
The selection of New York places Reju at the intersection of a major fashion hub and a region increasingly focused on circular economy legislation. The proximity to major apparel brands and a dense population ensures a steady supply of feedstock while minimizing the logistics required to transport waste.

By establishing domestic infrastructure, Reju aims to reduce the industry's reliance on exported waste and virgin petrochemicals. The facility is expected to play a pivotal role in helping U.S. brands meet impending sustainability targets and regulatory requirements regarding recycled content in textiles.
