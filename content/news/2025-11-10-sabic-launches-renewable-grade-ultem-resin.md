SABIC has launched the first certified renewable-grade ULTEM resin, marking a significant advancement in sustainable engineering plastics. This bio-based resin combines high heat resistance and mechanical strength, making it ideal for demanding electronics and aerospace applications. The announcement aligns with SABIC’s ongoing commitment to innovation and sustainability in specialty materials, supporting industries seeking high-performance yet eco-friendly solutions.

## Product Innovation

The new renewable-grade ULTEM resin is a bio-based polyetherimide (PEI) engineered to deliver the same performance and processability as conventional ULTEM materials but with a reduced carbon footprint. It offers exceptional thermal stability, mechanical robustness, and electrical insulation properties, suitable for high-temperature environments. SABIC’s development ensures compatibility with existing manufacturing processes, enabling seamless adoption without compromising quality or efficiency.

## Applications

This innovation addresses growing industry demands for sustainable materials in sectors such as electronics, aerospace, and automotive. The resin’s high heat resistance and strength make it suitable for components like connectors, sensor housings, and interior aerospace panels. By introducing a renewable-grade option, SABIC supports the bioplastics market’s expansion, which is projected to reach USD 22.23 billion by 2032. This launch reinforces SABIC’s strategic focus on reducing environmental impact while meeting stringent performance requirements in advanced manufacturing.
