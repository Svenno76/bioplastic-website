Kaneka Corporation, a Tokyo-based chemical giant specializing in innovative materials, announced in October 2025 a ¥12.4 billion investment to significantly expand production of its flagship PHBH biopolymer, known as KANEKA Biodegradable Polymer Green Planet™. Headquartered in Minato-ku, the company aims to meet surging global demand for sustainable alternatives amid marine plastic pollution concerns. This move builds on prior expansions at its Takasago Plant in Japan, reinforcing Kaneka's mission to deliver "Wellness First" solutions through biotechnology and polymer expertise.

## Funding Details

The ¥12.4 billion commitment targets enhanced capacity for PHBH, a 100% bio-based polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) produced via microbial fermentation of plant oils. This follows earlier investments, including a 2019 ¥2.5 billion upgrade to 5,000 tonnes/year and a 2022 capacity increase. PHBH holds "OK Biodegradable MARINE" certification, biodegrading 90% in seawater within six months at 30°C, and is approved by the FDA, EU, and others for food contact. The funding supports R&D and mass production to address rising needs in packaging and beyond.

## Strategic Use

This expansion positions Kaneka as a PHA market leader, with the sector projected to grow from USD 123.8 million in 2025 to USD 265.2 million by 2030 at a 16.5% CAGR, driven by regulations curbing single-use plastics. PHBH's versatility—compostable in soil, heat-resistant, and suitable for retail, electronics, and marine applications—fuels partnerships and innovations like stadium straws. It advances a circular economy, reducing microplastic pollution while leveraging Kaneka's 30-year biotech legacy for global sustainability.
