British startup **Carbon Cell** has launched a carbon-negative, fully compostable foam made from agricultural waste, offering a plastic-free alternative to expanded polystyrene (EPS). This innovation, unveiled recently, targets packaging and construction sectors by mimicking EPS performance without fossil fuels or microplastics, while sequestering CO₂.

## Product Innovation

Carbon Cell's foam uses **biochar**—a carbon-rich residue from pyrolyzed crop waste like potato peels and textile scraps—combined with bio-based polymers to form expandable pellets. Heated like popcorn, these create a rigid, deep-black foam with EPS-like cellular texture, thermal insulation, and strength—three times stronger than traditional EPS. Existing EPS equipment can be repurposed, enabling easy adoption and custom molding for complex shapes. Fully biodegradable, it locks away up to 2.1-3.6 tonnes of CO₂e per tonne of waste, making production carbon-negative.

## Applications

In the **bioplastics industry**, Carbon Cell disrupts polystyrene's dominance, projected to produce 2.5 million truckloads of EPS annually by 2024, by providing superior fire resistance, soundproofing, and compostability for insulation, acoustic panels, thermal packaging, automotive composites, and even film props. Construction emerges as the largest market, though certifications may delay scale-up. This scalable solution from waste reduces plastic pollution, regenerates soil post-use, and accelerates sustainable materials transition amid rising emissions pressures.
