Austrian masterbatch producer Gabriel-Chemie Group has officially announced the expansion of its international footprint with the opening of a new site in Nairobi, Kenya. This strategic move, effective January 2026, positions the family-owned company to better serve the rapidly growing East African plastics market, reinforcing its commitment to proximity and localized service.

## Strengthening the African Footprint

The decision to establish a dedicated sales subsidiary in Nairobi reflects Kenya’s status as a pivotal economic hub for East Africa. By localizing operations, Gabriel-Chemie aims to shorten supply chains and provide faster, more technical support to local converters. The region has seen increasing demand for high-quality packaging and consumer goods, necessitating advanced coloration and additive solutions that meet international standards.

The new site will focus on distributing the company's broad portfolio, ranging from standard color masterbatches to complex functional additives. This direct presence allows the company to respond more dynamically to regional market trends and specific customer requirements in the developing industrial landscape of East Africa.

## Bringing Sustainable Additives to Emerging Markets

A significant component of this expansion involves introducing Gabriel-Chemie’s sustainable product lines to the Kenyan market. The company is a recognized leader in developing masterbatches specifically designed for the bioplastics sector, including additives for PLA (Polylactic Acid) and other biodegradable polymers.

With Kenya maintaining some of the world’s strictest regulations on single-use plastics, there is a growing appetite for alternative materials and recycling-friendly solutions. Gabriel-Chemie’s presence will facilitate the distribution of their sustainable portfolio, such as near-infrared (NIR) detectable colors for sorting and additives that enhance the performance of post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics. This move ensures that local manufacturers have access to the necessary technical components to transition toward a circular economy.
