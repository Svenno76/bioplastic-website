thyssenkrupp Uhde, through its polymer specialists Uhde Inventa-Fischer (UIF), has forged a strategic partnership with Praj Industries Ltd. to provide an integrated, end-to-end technology for Polylactic Acid (PLA) production. This collaboration aims to significantly advance the bioplastics sector by offering a seamless, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solution to meet the growing global demand for alternatives to fossil-based plastics.

## Details of the Partnership

The alliance combines Uhde Inventa-Fischer's established PLAneo® process with Praj Industries' expertise in lactic acid production, delivering a comprehensive technology package. This integrated offering will cover the entire PLA production chain, from feedstock conversion to the final polymer. Nadja Håkansson, CEO of thyssenkrupp Uhde, emphasized the synergy, stating that the partnership allows them to design and deliver complete PLA plants. Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, Founder Chairman of Praj Industries, highlighted the collaboration's role in driving the global transition to a circular economy through cost-effective biomanufacturing and biorefinery development.

## Impact and Innovation

The joint technology will enable the production of various grades of lactic acid for food and industrial applications, as well as a broad range of PLA grades suitable for diverse industries such as packaging, textiles, and hygiene supplies. Both companies bring robust global presences and the capability to process a wide variety of agricultural feedstocks, including starch, sugar, and second-generation non-food raw materials. Praj Industries has also recently inaugurated India's first 'Demonstration Facility for Biopolymers' near Pune, which produces lactic acid and lactide, serving as a crucial platform for testing and validating this new joint offering and accelerating commercialization. This partnership represents a significant step towards making bioplastics more accessible and viable across industries, aligning with global sustainability goals and advancing the transition to greener alternatives.
