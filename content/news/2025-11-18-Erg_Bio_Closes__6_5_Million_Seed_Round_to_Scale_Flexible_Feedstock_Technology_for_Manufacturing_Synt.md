Erg Bio, an innovator in biomass valorization and advanced bioindustrial technology, announced on November 18, 2025, the successful closure of a $6.5 million seed funding round. This significant investment was led by Azolla Ventures, with additional participation from Chevron Technology Ventures, Freeflow, Plug and Play, and strategic angel investors. The capital infusion is earmarked for scaling Erg Bio’s proprietary Aspire™ Technology.

## Details

The Aspire™ Technology is a low-temperature pretreatment and catalytic platform designed to transform diverse agricultural and forestry wastes into affordable intermediates for synthetic aviation fuels (SAF) and critical bio-based chemicals. This advanced system builds on foundational research from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Joint BioEnergy Institute (JBEI). Notably, the technology is feedstock-flexible, capable of seamlessly processing over 30 different biomass types, which enhances supply-chain resilience and supports cost-effective regional and global deployment. CEO Vineet Rajgarhia stated that Erg Bio's goal is to convert overlooked, abundant resources into cost-competitive synthetic aviation fuels and biochemicals. The company also received a $1.5 million Department of Defense award to advance its ASPIRE™ Technology at pre-pilot scale.

## Impact

The funding will enable Erg Bio to strengthen technical validation and advance toward pilot-scale demonstrations, with plans to begin operating its first pilot facility, validate techno-economics, and produce multi-kilogram batches of fuel and material intermediates. This initiative is expected to bolster U.S. energy independence, support cleaner biomanufacturing, and contribute to domestic energy resilience. By converting residues that would otherwise be wasted into high-value fuels and chemicals, Erg Bio’s process enhances resource efficiency and supports rural economies. Investors like Amy Duffuor of Azolla Ventures highlight the platform's potential to reshape the supply chain for synthetic fuels and chemicals, driving growth in the emerging bioeconomy.
