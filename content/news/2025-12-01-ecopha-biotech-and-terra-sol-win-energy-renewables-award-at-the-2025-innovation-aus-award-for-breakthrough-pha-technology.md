**EcoPHA Biotech and Terra Sol Studio Secure 2025 InnovationAus Energy & Renewables Award**

EcoPHA Biotech and design partner Terra Sol Studio have won the 2025 InnovationAus Energy & Renewables Award, recognizing their breakthrough polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) technology. The Australian partnership achieved a world-first by successfully converting pongamia oil—a non-edible renewable resource—into biodegradable bioplastic. This recognition highlights their joint leadership in sustainable biotechnology and design innovation, positioning Australia as a global leader in the bioeconomy.

## Product Innovation

EcoPHA's patented PHA manufacturing process represents a significant advancement in sustainable materials. The technology converts pongamia oil, derived from the pongamia tree, into a home-compostable and marine-biodegradable plastic suitable for everyday applications. Terra Sol has commercialized this innovation into certified compostable products including coffee cups, lids, straws, and cutlery, all manufactured in Australia. The process also qualifies for carbon credits through pongamia cultivation, which actively absorbs carbon dioxide, enhancing economic viability.

## Applications and Industry Impact

EcoPHA's dual-output system delivers both cleaner fuels and bioplastics, addressing critical sustainability challenges. The technology targets hard-to-abate sectors including aviation and freight through sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel production. Key industries—energy, mining, and large-scale manufacturing—increasingly demand carbon reduction solutions that EcoPHA's biodegradable alternatives provide. The Queensland-based project positions the partnership to supply sustainable products for the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games, showcasing Australian innovation globally. This breakthrough demonstrates how integrated biotech solutions can simultaneously reduce plastic waste and fossil fuel dependency.
