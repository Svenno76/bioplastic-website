Braskem, a global leader in biopolymer production, unveiled its innovative I'm green bio-based high-density polyethylene (HDPE) at K 2025 in Düsseldorf, Germany. This new material, derived from sugarcane ethanol, represents a significant stride in sustainable plastic alternatives, specifically targeting applications in non-wovens and Machine Direction-Oriented (MDO) films. The launch highlights Braskem's commitment to accelerating the transformation of the plastics industry towards a more circular economy.

## Details

The I'm green bio-based HDPE for non-wovens is specifically designed for the hygiene market, including applications like diapers and bi-component fiber products. It offers superior performance characteristics such as low gel levels, excellent processing stability, improved heat resistance, and great color stability. This ensures reliability in high-performance hygiene applications, performing well in both bi-component spunbond and mono-component spunbound processes. An updated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from 2023 indicates a carbon footprint of -2.01 kgCO₂e per kg for this material, underscoring its contribution to more sustainable hygiene solutions.

For MDO films, the bio-based polyethylene enhances stiffness, optical properties, and recyclability, enabling mono-material packaging solutions such as flow packs, MDO labels, and stand-up pouches. These films were developed in collaboration with Cazoolo, Braskem's circular packaging design lab, and converter FCO Group, emphasizing a collaborative approach to circular economy goals.

## Impact

The introduction of this bio-based HDPE underscores Braskem's strategic vision to scale up solutions that combine technical performance with environmental benefits. By utilizing sugarcane ethanol as a renewable feedstock, the material significantly reduces the carbon footprint of plastic products. This innovation is pivotal for industries seeking to enhance the sustainability profile of their packaging and hygiene applications, supporting the transition towards more environmentally friendly materials and improved recyclability of end products.
