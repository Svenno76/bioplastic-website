Eastman, a global specialty materials provider, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Kolmar Korea, a leading original design manufacturer (ODM) in the cosmetics industry, to advance the adoption of biodegradable materials in personal care products. The collaboration aims to leverage Eastman’s expertise in cellulose technology to address the growing demand for environmentally responsible beauty solutions.

## Advancing Cellulose-Based Innovation

Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will collaborate on the application of Eastman’s biobased and biodegradable materials within Kolmar Korea’s extensive manufacturing portfolio. The partnership focuses primarily on utilizing Eastman’s cellulose esters, which are derived from sustainably sourced wood pulp. These materials offer a certified biodegradable alternative to traditional petrochemical-based plastics often used in cosmetic packaging and formulation ingredients.

By integrating these biopolymers, Kolmar Korea aims to reduce the environmental footprint of its supply chain, specifically targeting the reduction of microplastics in rinse-off products and improving the end-of-life profile for cosmetic packaging. Eastman will provide technical support and material supply, ensuring that the new applications meet rigorous performance standards while complying with international biodegradability certifications.

## Targeting the Global K-Beauty Market

Kolmar Korea serves as a key manufacturing hub for numerous major global beauty brands. This strategic alliance positions Eastman’s bioplastic solutions at the forefront of the influential "K-Beauty" sector, potentially accelerating the mass adoption of biodegradable alternatives across the industry.

Both companies have expressed a commitment to regulatory compliance and sustainable stewardship. As governments worldwide implement stricter regulations regarding plastic waste and microplastic pollution, this partnership is designed to provide brand owners with immediate, scalable solutions that align with the circular economy. The companies expect to unveil prototypes utilizing the new material applications later this year.
