In a significant move toward circular packaging within the nutrition sector, Live Puri has announced the replacement of traditional metal closures with renewable fiber-based caps. The transition utilizes the "NutraCap," a proprietary solution developed by Swedish start-up Blue Ocean Closures, marking a commercial milestone for bio-based packaging applications in 2026.

## Replacing Metal with Cellulose

Live Puri, known for its clean-label protein products, selected the NutraCap to address the environmental impact of its supply chain. Historically, the supplement and nutrition industry has relied heavily on metal or rigid plastic lids, which contribute significantly to packaging weight and carbon emissions.

The NutraCap is manufactured using vacuum-pressed forming technology, utilizing sustainably sourced wood fibers. Unlike composite materials that are difficult to separate, this closure is designed to be fully bio-based. By switching from standard metal closures to Blue Ocean Closures' fiber alternative, Live Puri aims to significantly reduce the embodied carbon of their packaging while eliminating the extraction of non-renewable ores associated with aluminum or tinplate production.

## Advancing Paper Recycling Streams

A primary driver for this adoption is the compatibility of the closure with existing recycling infrastructure. The fiber screw caps are designed to be recycled directly in standard paper streams, facilitating a smoother end-of-life process for consumers. This contrasts with metal closures, which often require separation from plastic or glass containers to be effectively recovered.

Blue Ocean Closures has engineered the NutraCap to maintain critical barrier properties necessary for food safety and shelf stability, ensuring that the switch to fiber does not compromise product integrity. This collaboration demonstrates the scalability of vacuum-formed fiber technologies, moving them from prototype stages into active commercial retail environments.
