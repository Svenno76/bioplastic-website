## Details

British company Carbon Cell is nearing production with a groundbreaking plastic-free alternative to polystyrene. The innovative material is a carbon-negative, compostable rigid foam derived from agricultural waste, specifically biochar. This self-titled product from Carbon Cell is designed to replace traditional expanded polystyrene (EPS) in various applications, offering a sustainable solution to plastic pollution.

The foam is created by processing agricultural waste into biochar, which is then combined with natural, bio-based polymers to form pellets. These pellets are subsequently expanded into a lightweight, thermally insulative, and structurally stable rigid foam. Visually, the material resembles expanded polystyrene but features a distinct moody black color. Key advantages include its plastic-free composition, full compostability, and its ability to sequester carbon, making it a carbon-negative solution; for every kilogram of Carbon Cell foam produced, nearly a kilogram (or even two kilograms according to some estimates) of carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere.

## Innovation and Impact

Carbon Cell's foam exhibits similar, and in some cases, superior performance characteristics to polystyrene, including excellent insulation and protective qualities. The primary target markets are packaging and building insulation, areas where polystyrene currently has a significant environmental footprint.

Beyond these core applications, Carbon Cell is exploring broader uses, including acoustic paneling, interior design elements, thermal packaging, automotive composites, and even props for the film, TV, and theater industries. The company's patent-pending technology aims to help manufacturers decarbonize and reduce their reliance on fossil-based foams like EPS, EPP, and PIR/PUR. This development positions Carbon Cell as a significant player in advancing bio-based materials and fostering a circular economy by turning agricultural waste into high-performance, environmentally beneficial products. The material was invented by scientist Elizabeth Lee, engineer Eden Harrison, and designer Ori Blich, originating from studies at Imperial College of London and the Royal College of Art.
