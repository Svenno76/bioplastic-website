Braskem’s Sustainable Development Director, Jorge Soto, called for stronger public policies to drive biopolymer demand and research at COP30, the UN Climate Change Conference. Speaking in Brazil, Soto emphasized the importance of industry collaboration and regulatory support to scale renewable materials and accelerate the transition to a circular, low-carbon economy.

## Collaboration Details

At COP30, Braskem advocated for integrated policies that incentivize renewable content in plastics and boost R&D investment. The company highlighted its leadership in biopolymer production, particularly its I’m Green™ polyethylene made from sugarcane ethanol. Soto stressed the need for requirements mandating renewable or recycled content, as well as incentives to reduce capital costs and foster innovation. Braskem’s participation included panel discussions on Brazil’s bioeconomy, sustainable carbon, and decarbonization pathways.

## Expected Outcomes

Braskem’s push for policy action is expected to strengthen the bioplastics industry by creating a more favorable regulatory environment and encouraging broader adoption of renewable materials. The company’s efforts align with Brazil’s National Bioeconomy Strategy, which promotes biomass production and bioindustrialization. By formalizing pathways for sustainable development and scaling biopolymer supply, Braskem aims to help reduce carbon footprints across the chemical and packaging sectors, positioning biopolymers as a viable alternative to fossil-based plastics.
