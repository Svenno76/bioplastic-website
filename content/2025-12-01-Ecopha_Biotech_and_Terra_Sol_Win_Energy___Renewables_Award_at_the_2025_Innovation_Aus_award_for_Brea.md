## Details of the Breakthrough

Australian innovator Ecopha Biotech, in collaboration with design partner Terra Sol Studio, has been honored with the prestigious Energy & Renewables Award at the 2025 InnovationAus Awards for Excellence. This recognition celebrates their pioneering work in developing breakthrough PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) bioplastics. The innovative materials are now produced using carbon-negative pongamia oil, marking a significant advancement in sustainable bioplastics manufacturing. Ecopha Biotech holds a world-first patent for converting pongamia oil into PHA, a non-edible and resilient resource that actively sequesters carbon and improves soil health. This shift from previous feedstocks to pongamia oil further enhances the environmental impact and cost efficiency of their production process.

## Features and Impact

The PHA bioplastics developed by Ecopha Biotech and Terra Sol Studio are designed to biodegrade naturally within months and are fully home-compostable, eliminating microplastic pollution. This makes them a truly scalable and sustainable alternative to conventional petroleum-based plastics across diverse sectors, including packaging, agriculture, healthcare, consumer goods, textiles, and biomedical materials. The collaboration between Ecopha's scientific innovation and Terra Sol's design expertise has created one of Australia's first end-to-end PHA commercialization pipelines, poised for immediate industry adoption. This national honor positions them as a leading climate-tech collaboration globally, transforming scientific breakthroughs into commercially viable products.

## Future Outlook

Following their award win, Ecopha Biotech and Terra Sol Studio plan an ambitious global expansion strategy, with market entry into the United States, Europe, China, Singapore, and broader Asia-Pacific regions slated for 2026. Their innovation aligns with global sustainability goals, offering substantial economic and environmental benefits. Ecopha is also pioneering a world-first integrated process to produce both renewable biofuels and marine-biodegradable bioplastics from a single pongamia oil feedstock, further maximizing resource value and reducing waste.
