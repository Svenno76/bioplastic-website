## Overview

CARBIOS is a pioneering French biotechnology company founded in 2011, specializing in enzyme-based processes for PET biorecycling and plastic biodegradation. The company has developed revolutionary enzymatic technology enabling recycling of PET plastic waste into virgin-quality materials without performance loss. CARBIOS is listed on Euronext Paris and represents a major breakthrough in circular economy solutions.

## Core Technology: Enzymatic PET Recycling

- **Enzyme Innovation**: Uses engineered enzymes from naturally occurring bacteria, modified for enhanced PET degradation efficiency
- **Depolymerization Process**: Enzymes specifically cleave PET polymer chains into monomers
- **Pure Monomer Recovery**: Produces virgin-quality monomers for repolymerization without quality degradation
- **100% Recyclable Output**: Enables production of 100% recycled, 100% recyclable PET products

## Key Advantages

- **Quality Preservation**: Unlike mechanical recycling, enzymatic recycling maintains virgin material properties
- **Universal Feedstock Compatibility**: Processes all PET waste types including contaminated materials
- **True Circular Economy**: Enables infinite recycling cycles without performance loss

## Industrial Operations

**Demonstration Plant (Operational)**:
- Location: Clermont-Ferrand, France (Michelin Group site)
- Status: Operational since September 2021
- Capacity: Validates technical, environmental, and economic viability

**Commercial Manufacturing Partnership with Indorama Ventures**:
- Location: Longlaville, Meurthe-et-Moselle, France
- Capacity: 50,000 tonnes PET waste annually (~2 billion bottles or 300 million T-shirts)
- Status: World's first biorecycling plant; construction timeline subject to funding

## Applications

- **Beverage Packaging**: High-quality bottles and containers
- **Textile and Apparel**: Fibers for clothing and textiles
- **Food Packaging**: Food-contact grade applications
- **Technical Uses**: Industrial and specialized applications

## Environmental Benefits

- **Waste Valorization**: Converts waste PET into high-value virgin materials
- **Energy Efficiency**: Lower temperatures than conventional chemical recycling
- **Carbon Reduction**: Significantly reduced emissions vs. virgin PET production
- **Infinite Recycling**: No material degradation through recycling cycles

## Investment and Recognition

- Listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: CARB)
- Major strategic partnerships with leading global plastic manufacturers
- Recognition as breakthrough circular economy technology

## Future Strategy

- Demonstrate technical and economic viability at commercial scale
- Potential geographic expansion across Europe and globally
- Technology licensing opportunities
- Market leadership in PET biorecycling
