## Overview

String Bio represents one of India's most innovative and well-capitalized bioplastics technology companies, pioneering a fundamentally different approach to biopolymer synthesis through synthetic biology and methane conversion. Founded in 2012 by a team of biotechnology innovators, String Bio has developed proprietary fermentation technology that leverages advances in synthetic biology to convert methane—available from waste streams or renewable sources—into valuable chemical monomers that serve as building blocks for biodegradable polymers, high-performance polymers, protein ingredients, and specialized chemicals.

Unlike traditional biopolymer pathways that rely on agricultural feedstocks (sugarcane, corn, cellulose), String Bio's methane-to-products platform offers significant advantages: independence from food-competing crops, utilization of otherwise-flared or waste methane, and ability to locate production near methane sources (landfills, agricultural operations, natural gas infrastructure). This technological differentiation positions String Bio as a next-generation biopolymer innovator with potential to address methane emissions while creating valuable products.

The company's funding success—having raised $20.1M from prominent investors including Woodside Energy—demonstrates investor confidence in the technology platform and commercial viability of methane-to-biopolymers conversion. Woodside Energy's partnership signals strategic interest in methane utilization and circular carbon economy solutions, positioning String Bio as a bridging company between energy sector infrastructure and sustainable materials manufacturing.
