## Overview

Emirates Biotech represents a transformative initiative in sustainable bioplastics for the Middle East and India region. Based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, the company is developing the world's largest polylactic acid (PLA) production facility with an unprecedented planned capacity of 160,000 tonnes per annum. This mega-scale facility positions Emirates Biotech to revolutionize bioplastics availability and affordability across the Middle East, Asia, and adjacent regions.

The company's mission is to accelerate the transition to a circular economy by offering plant-based polymers with reduced carbon footprint that are fully recyclable and biodegradable, supporting the region's sustainability commitments and global climate goals.

### World-Scale PLA Production Facility

**Strategic Location**: The facility is being constructed in the KEZAD (Khalifa Economic Zone Abu Dhabi) free zone, providing:
- Direct deep seaport access via the Port of Khalifa
- Strategic geographic positioning for Middle East, Africa, and Asia markets
- Free zone advantages for manufacturing and logistics
- Infrastructure and utilities already in place

**Phased Capacity Development**: The facility is designed in two equal phases:
- **Phase 1**: 80,000 MT/year capacity
- **Phase 2**: 80,000 MT/year additional capacity
- **Total Capacity**: 160,000 MT/year (world's largest PLA facility when fully operational)

**Construction Timeline**:
- Construction commencement: Q4 2025
- Operational target: Early 2028
- Phased startup supporting market absorption and optimization

### Primary Materials and Technology

**Embio PLA Brand**: Emirates Biotech produces a comprehensive portfolio of PLA grades under the Embio brand name:
