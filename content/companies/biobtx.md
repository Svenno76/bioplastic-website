## Overview

BioBTX is a pioneering chemical technology company based in Groningen, Netherlands, specializing in converting plastic waste and biomass into renewable aromatic chemicals. Founded in 2018, BioBTX has developed the proprietary Integrated Cascading Catalytic Pyrolysis (ICCP) technology. The company has secured over €80 million in funding to build the world's first commercial-scale renewable aromatics production plant (PETRA).

## Core Technology: ICCP Process

BioBTX's proprietary Integrated Cascading Catalytic Pyrolysis (ICCP) technology:

- **Plastic Waste Conversion**: Converts mixed plastic waste and biomass into high-value aromatic chemicals
- **BTX Production**: Produces benzene, toluene, and xylenes (BTX) - essential chemical building blocks
- **Optimized Efficiency**: Maximizes BTX yield while minimizing operational costs
- **Flexible Feedstocks**: Processes both contaminated mixed plastics and various biomass streams

## Key Innovations

- **Chemical Recycling Breakthrough**: One of few companies demonstrating conversion of both biomass and waste plastics into valuable chemicals at scale
- **Cost-Effective Production**: Commercially viable compared to fossil aromatic production
- **Waste Valorization**: Transforms low-value mixed plastic waste into premium chemical intermediates

## PETRA Commercial Plant

- **Location**: Netherlands
- **Capacity**: 20,000 tonnes mixed plastic waste annually
- **Timeline**: Expected production by late 2026
- **Investment**: Over €80 million in secured funding

## Applications

Renewable aromatics from BioBTX serve critical industries:
- Insulating foams for construction and thermal applications
- Coatings and industrial resins
- PET bottle production
- Battery component manufacturing
- Pharmaceutical synthesis

## Geographic Presence

Headquartered in Groningen, Netherlands, with focus on European market development.

## Business Model and Strategy

- Purchases mixed plastic waste at economic rates
- Converts waste into premium chemical products
- Supplies renewable aromatics to chemical manufacturers
- Participates in circular economy value chains
