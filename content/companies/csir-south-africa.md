## Overview

The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is South Africa's leading national research institution and a continental driver of innovation in sustainable materials. Founded in 1945, CSIR has evolved into a multi-disciplinary research organization with expertise spanning chemicals, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental technologies. In the bioplastics domain, CSIR has emerged as a pioneering developer of innovative biodegradable and compostable plastic materials that address one of the world's most pressing environmental challenges.

CSIR's bioplastics research program, led by scientists in the polymers and composites division, has developed proprietary technology producing 100% biodegradable plastics from renewable agricultural feedstocks. Unlike conventional bioplastics that require industrial composting facilities, CSIR's formulations achieve complete biodegradation in standard landfill conditions (180 days) and accelerated compostable conditions (90 days), without leaving toxic residues. This innovation has earned CSIR recognition as a Champion of the Earth by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), positioning South African science at the forefront of circular economy innovation.

Based in Pretoria with multiple research facilities across South Africa, CSIR operates as an autonomous national research entity reporting to South Africa's Department of Science and Innovation, giving the organization strategic importance in the country's innovation ecosystem and access to national research infrastructure.
