## Overview

Blue Circle Olefins is a pioneering Dutch company founded in 2022, developing the world's first large-scale circular methanol-to-olefins production facility in Rotterdam, Netherlands. The company's innovative technology platform converts renewable methanol—derived from waste plastics, agricultural residues, biogas, and green hydrogen combined with captured CO₂—into 100% circular ethylene and propylene suitable as drop-in replacements for conventional fossil-derived polyolefins.

With planned production capacity of 200,000 tons/year and target operational start in 2030, Blue Circle Olefins represents a transformative approach to circular plastic production, addressing approximately 50% of the global plastic market (polyolefins including PE and PP). The company's technology offers potential for 80%+ lifecycle greenhouse gas reduction compared to conventional polyolefins, supporting global decarbonization objectives while enabling existing plastic processing infrastructure utilization.
