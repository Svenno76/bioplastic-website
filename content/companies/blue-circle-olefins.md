## Overview

Blue Circle Olefins is developing the first circular methanol-to-olefins production plant in the Netherlands, aiming to produce 100% circular ethylene and propylene as drop-in replacements for fossil-based olefins. Their technology converts renewable methanol derived from biogas, bio-waste, mixed plastic waste, and green hydrogen with captured CO₂ into essential chemical building blocks for plastics, targeting an 80% reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional foss...
