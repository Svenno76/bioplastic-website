## Overview

Bioelements represents the emerging wave of Latin American sustainable packaging innovation, establishing itself as a regional leader in biobased, biodegradable, and compostable packaging solutions. Founded in 2014 by Chilean lawyers Ignacio Parada and Juan Eduardo Joannon, Bioelements has rapidly scaled to serve over 250 customers across seven countries spanning Chile, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and the United States. The company's founding vision addresses a critical environmental challenge: the massive accumulation of conventional plastic packaging waste in Latin America and globally, offering sustainable alternatives that integrate seamlessly into consumer and commercial applications.

Bioelements operates a decentralized production and distribution model across its geographic footprint, producing proprietary biobased, biodegradable, and compostable polymers that degrade completely within a maximum of 20 months in appropriate environmental conditions. The company's success in attracting USD 30 million in funding from prominent investors including BTG Pactual and Endeavor reflects investor confidence in the business model, market opportunity, and company execution. Bioelements' geographic reach, customer base, and product diversity position it as a defining company in Latin America's transition toward sustainable packaging solutions.

The company's product portfolio spans three primary categories—Bio Retail (shopping bags), Bio Food (food storage packaging), and Bio Non-Food (non-food applications)—addressing diverse consumer and commercial needs with approximately 30 distinct formulations. This comprehensive approach to sustainable packaging demonstrates Bioelements' commitment to providing viable alternatives to conventional plastic packaging across diverse market segments.
