## Overview

Raizen Sugarcane Company stands as the world's largest sugarcane processor and a dominant force in Brazil's renewable energy and biofuels sector. Headquartered in Piracicaba, São Paulo, Raizen operates as a leading producer of renewable fuels and chemicals derived from sugarcane, leveraging Brazil's natural competitive advantages in agricultural biomass. The company processes billions of liters of sugarcane ethanol annually and generates nearly 3 TWh of renewable electricity through bagasse-based cogeneration, making it not only a major producer of conventional fuels but also a critical enabler of Brazil's bioplastics industry.

Raizen's strategic importance to the bioplastics sector extends beyond simple ethanol production. The company supplies high-purity bio-ethanol feedstock to Braskem, the world's largest bio-based polyethylene (I'm green™) producer. This integration of sugarcane processing with downstream biopolymer synthesis exemplifies the integrated value chain that gives Brazil its competitive advantage in bio-based materials. Raizen's feedstock represents the foundation upon which Braskem produces 275,000+ metric tons per year of bio-PE, making Raizen an essential component of the Brazilian bioplastics ecosystem.

Additionally, Raizen has pioneered second-generation ethanol (E2G) production through partnership with Canadian biotech company Iogen, making it the only company in the world producing cellulosic ethanol at commercial scale. This technological leadership in advanced biofuels positions Raizen at the forefront of biomass valorization, extracting maximum value from every component of the sugarcane plant. Recent innovations in lignin utilization through partnership with Dutch company Vertoro demonstrate Raizen's commitment to circular bioeconomy principles.

## Primary Technologies and Products

Raizen's core technology platform centers on advanced sugarcane processing and fermentation, extracting value from multiple components of the sugarcane plant simultaneously. The company's integrated approach maximizes feedstock utilization and demonstrates principles of circular bioeconomy application at industrial scale.

### First-Generation Bio-Ethanol (E1G)

Raizen's primary product is conventional bio-ethanol produced through traditional fermentation of sugarcane juice. The company produces over 3.5 billion liters annually, representing approximately 10% of global ethanol production. This bio-ethanol serves multiple markets:
- Direct fuel use (E85 ethanol blends, gasoline additives)
- Chemical and pharmaceutical intermediates
- Bioplastic feedstock for Braskem bio-PE production
- Renewable chemical synthesis

The bio-ethanol's purity and consistency enable direct use in advanced biopolymer synthesis, supporting Braskem's ability to produce food-contact grade bio-PE with complete renewable content. Raizen's large-scale production provides feedstock security for Braskem's capacity expansion roadmap targeting 1 million MT/year by 2030.

### Second-Generation Ethanol (E2G)

Raizen's partnership with Iogen for cellulosic ethanol production represents a technological breakthrough in biomass valorization. Unlike first-generation ethanol derived from sugarcane juice, E2G converts cellulose and hemicellulose from bagasse (sugarcane residue) into fermentable sugars. This approach:
- Utilizes previously underutilized sugarcane residues
- Achieves 90% greenhouse gas reduction vs. Brazilian gasoline
- Demonstrates 30% carbon footprint reduction vs. E1G
- Scales biomass utilization across multiple plant components
- Supports circular economy principles

E2G production positions Raizen as the world's leading producer of cellulosic ethanol at commercial scale, differentiating the company as a technology leader in advanced biofuels and supporting future biopolymer feedstock diversification.

### Renewable Electricity and Biomass Cogeneration

Raizen operates bagasse-fired cogeneration facilities generating approximately 2.9 TWh of renewable electricity annually. This self-powered energy strategy:
- Eliminates external fossil fuel dependence for operations
- Produces excess electricity for grid supply
- Utilizes bagasse that would otherwise be waste
- Supports renewable energy credentials
- Creates integrated biorefinery efficiency

### Renewable Chemicals and Advanced Products

Beyond ethanol and electricity, Raizen develops renewable chemical intermediates for applications in cosmetics, fragrances, paint and varnish production, and advanced materials. The company's feedstock-to-chemical platform demonstrates sugarcane's potential as a multipurpose renewable resource.

### Lignin Valorization Platform

Raizen's recent partnership with Vertoro (Netherlands) targets new applications for lignin, a by-product of cellulosic ethanol production. This initiative converts lignin residues into advanced biofuels, biochemical intermediates, and specialty materials, exemplifying waste valorization in circular bioeconomy models.

## Market Segments and Applications

Raizen serves diverse markets across renewable fuels, chemicals, and materials sectors, with growing emphasis on feedstock supply for bioplastics manufacturers.
