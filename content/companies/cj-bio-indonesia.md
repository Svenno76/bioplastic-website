## Overview

CJ Bio Indonesia represents a transformative investment in Southeast Asia's bioplastics capacity and technology advancement, operating the region's most sophisticated polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production facility. Established as a subsidiary of South Korea's CJ CheilJedang, a global leader in biochemistry and biopolymers, CJ Bio Indonesia commercialized its Pasuruan facility in May 2022 with an initial 5,000 metric ton annual capacity focused on amorphous PHA production.

The facility represents the culmination of CJ's decades-long commitment to advanced biopolymer development, building on technology acquired from Metabolix in 2016 and refined through continuous innovation. With ambitious capacity expansion plans targeting 65,000 MT by 2025 and ultimately 300,000 MT by 2030, CJ Bio Indonesia positions itself as a critical enabler of Southeast Asia's transition toward advanced biodegradable materials and circular economy development.

The company's focus on amorphous PHA—a softer, more rubbery form of polyhydroxyalkanoate—differentiates its product portfolio and enables applications distinct from crystalline or semi-crystalline PHA forms, providing customers with diverse performance characteristics for specialized and emerging bioplastic applications.
