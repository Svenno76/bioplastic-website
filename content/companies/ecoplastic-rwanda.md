## Overview

EcoPlastic Rwanda stands as a pioneering force in East Africa's plastic waste valorization, operating within Rwanda's globally recognized commitment to environmental protection and circular economy principles. Founded in 2011 in response to Rwanda's pioneering 2008 ban on non-biodegradable plastic bags, EcoPlastic has evolved into a significant recycler and plastic transformation enterprise collecting substantial quantities of plastic waste, processing it through recycling techniques, and converting recovered materials into functional products for agricultural, construction, and industrial applications.

Based in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, EcoPlastic operates within Africa's most stringent plastic control framework, enabling the company to develop business models dependent on waste collection and valorization. The company collects approximately 88 tonnes of plastic waste annually from diverse sources including waste collection companies, individuals, airports, and hospitals, transforming this material through recycling processes into new plastic products supporting Rwanda's circular economy development.

EcoPlastic's significance extends beyond current operational scale: the company represents a viable model for African plastic waste valorization and circular economy participation, demonstrating economic viability of waste collection and processing at African scale. In the context of emerging bioplastics adoption, EcoPlastic's waste collection and processing infrastructure creates potential for integration with mixed plastic-bioplastic waste streams and emerging circular material flow systems.
