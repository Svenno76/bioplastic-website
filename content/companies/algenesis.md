## Overview

Algenesis is an innovative biotechnology company headquartered in San Diego, California, dedicated to creating sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based polyurethane plastics. Founded in 2016 by three professors from UC San Diego—Dr. Stephen Mayfield, Dr. Michael Burkart, and Dr. Robert Pomeroy—the company has developed groundbreaking plant-based and algae-derived materials under its proprietary Soleic® technology platform.

The company operates with a focused mission to help the planet recover from pollution caused by fossil fuel-derived plastics by developing fully renewable, biodegradable polyurethane products that match or exceed the performance of conventional petroleum-based alternatives. With approximately 50-100 employees, Algenesis operates from its headquarters in Cardiff-by-the-Sea in San Diego's Sorrento Valley, a hub for biotechnology innovation. The company's vision centers on commercializing advanced, sustainable polymers that offer superior environmental profiles without compromising durability or functionality.

Dr. Stephen Mayfield, founder and CEO, brings extensive experience in biotechnology and entrepreneurship, having previously founded Sapphire Energy (algae biotechnology), Rincon Pharmaceuticals, and Triton Health and Nutrition. His leadership, combined with the scientific expertise of Chief Scientist Dr. Michael Burkart and Head of Analytics Rob Pomeroy, positions Algenesis at the forefront of sustainable material science innovation.

### Primary Technologies and Focus

**Soleic® Technology Platform**: Algenesis's cornerstone innovation is Soleic®, the world's first renewable, fully biodegradable, and backyard-compostable bioPolyurethane (bioPU) made from plants and algae. Unlike conventional petroleum-based polyurethane, Soleic® polyols are produced from plant-derived dicarboxylic acids and non-food plant materials, creating sustainable polymers that decompose naturally in compost within months rather than persisting for decades in landfills.

**Soleic® Polyurethane Products**: Algenesis produces soft foam polyurethane materials suitable for insoles, midsoles, and cushioning applications in footwear. The company has validated third-party certification showing 52% bio-content in current products, with a development target of reaching 98% bio-content. Soleic® PU offers performance characteristics equivalent to or superior to petroleum-based polyurethane while eliminating harmful perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals found in other plastics.

**Bio-Iso™ Isocyanate Breakthrough**: In August 2025, Algenesis announced a major breakthrough with the commissioning of its Bio-Iso™ pilot plant, which produces the world's first 100% biogenic carbon isocyanate made entirely from plants. This technology is transformative because:
- Bio-Iso™ is synthesized from plant-based dicarboxylic acids without using toxic phosgene (a hazardous chemical used in conventional isocyanate production)
- Combined with Soleic® polyol, Bio-Iso™ enables production of 100% biobased thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) validated through ASTM D6866-24 analysis
- The process achieves truly circular, sustainable materials without compromising performance durability
- Current pilot production capacity: approximately one kilogram per day, sufficient for prototype development and initial customer sampling

**Environmental Credentials**: Algenesis materials reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% compared to petroleum-based polyurethane production. Products are free of harmful PFAS additives and fully biodegradable in appropriate composting environments, addressing both climate and pollution concerns simultaneously.

**Production Facilities**: The company operates research and development laboratories in San Diego with pilot-scale manufacturing capabilities. Current efforts focus on scaling the Bio-Iso™ pilot plant and establishing manufacturing partnerships to support commercial-scale production.

### Market Segments and Applications

Algenesis targets multiple high-growth markets where sustainable, high-performance materials command premium positioning:

**Footwear Industry**: Primary initial market focus, with applications in shoe midsoles, insoles, and foam cushioning components. The footwear sector increasingly demands sustainable materials to meet consumer environmental expectations and regulatory requirements in key markets including the EU and North America.

**Apparel and Textiles**: Expansion into breathable, waterproof textile applications using Soleic® materials, enabling sustainable outerwear, athletic wear, and performance fabrics.

**Consumer Products**: Phone cases, protective equipment, and other injection-molded components where durability and sustainable credentials provide competitive differentiation.

**Industrial Applications**: High-performance foam applications in automotive, furniture, and consumer goods manufacturing where bio-based materials support corporate sustainability commitments.

**Geographic Markets**: Initial commercialization focuses on North America and Europe, where regulatory drivers (EU Plastics Strategy, PFAS restrictions) and consumer preference for sustainable products are strongest. Long-term expansion targets Asia-Pacific and other global markets.

### Industry Position and Partnerships

Algenesis operates in the rapidly expanding bio-based polymers segment of the bioplastics industry, positioned between established petrochemical companies and emerging biotechnology startups. The company's competitive advantages include:

- **Patent Protection**: Proprietary Soleic® technology and Bio-Iso™ isocyanate processes provide strong intellectual property protection
- **Technical Differentiation**: Only company producing true 100% plant-based isocyanates without phosgene, eliminating major safety and environmental concerns
- **Biodegradability**: Full biodegradability in composting environments differentiates Soleic® from many competing "bio-based" plastics that remain persistent
- **Performance Parity**: Materials deliver performance equivalent to petroleum-based polyurethane, avoiding the performance compromises of some alternative materials

**Strategic Partnerships and Customers**: Algenesis is actively partnering with footwear brands, athletic apparel companies, and injection-molded product manufacturers to develop and commercialize Soleic® materials. The company seeks strategic partners for global industrial-scale commercialization. Initial customer engagement has generated prototypes and validation samples with interested brands across footwear and consumer products sectors.

**Industry Recognition**: Algenesis participates in sustainability-focused investor networks and industry groups focused on circular economy solutions and bio-based materials. The company's innovation has generated significant attention from venture capital, impact investors, and corporate sustainability teams seeking alternatives to petroleum-based polyurethane.
