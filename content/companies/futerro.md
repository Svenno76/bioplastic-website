## Overview

Futerro is a Belgian bioplastics company headquartered in Battice and founded in 1992, specializing in the production of PLA (polylactic acid) biopolymers and mastery of the complete lactic acid value chain. The company uniquely controls the entire PLA lifecycle from feedstock processing through lactic acid production to commercial polymer synthesis, providing integrated vertical integration advantages that few competitors can match.

With a demonstration facility in Belgium established in 2007 and a large-scale production facility in China with 100,000 MT/year capacity (operational since 2021), Futerro has proven the commercial viability of PLA production at scale. The company is currently pursuing an ambitious European expansion project with €500 million investment in a facility in the Rouen-Le Havre region of Normandy, France, which will add 75,000 MT/year of PLA production and 75,000 MT/year of PLA recycling capacity.

### Futeon PLA Technology and Vertical Integration

**Futeon Brand Portfolio**: Futerro produces a comprehensive range of PLA grades under the Futeon brand name:
- Various molecular weight formulations for different applications
- High-heat and specialized performance grades
- Food-contact compliant PLA grades

- Conversion of recycled PLA back to Futeon resins
- True circular economy closure for PLA materials
- Reduced dependency on virgin lactic acid production

**Recycled Content Grades**: Futerro develops recycled content PLA grades, supporting customer sustainability commitments and circular economy requirements.

### Industry Position and Significance

Futerro represents a mature, established player in the PLA market with 30+ years of bioplastics experience. The company's vertical integration from lactic acid through PLA polymerization, combined with proven manufacturing capabilities and major facility expansions, positions it as one of the world's largest PLA producers.

### Strategic Advantages

**Vertical Integration**: Control over the entire PLA value chain provides cost, supply, and quality advantages vs competitors dependent on external lactic acid sourcing.

**Proven Manufacturing**: 20+ years of successful PLA commercial operations and continuous production expansion demonstrate technical competence and market acceptance.

**European Expansion**: The France facility expansion positions Futerro as a major European PLA producer, supporting regional supply requirements and sustainability commitments.

**Recycling Capability**: Integration of PLA recycling into the production facility creates true circular economy value and differentiates Futerro from competitors focused only on virgin production.

**Feedstock Security**: Partnership with Tereos ensures long-term European feedstock supply, reducing supply chain risks and supporting economic resilience.

### Future Outlook

With the France expansion targeting 175,000 MT/year combined capacity (75,000 new production + 75,000 recycling), Futerro is positioned to become one of the world's largest PLA producers and a leader in circular PLA solutions. The company's vertical integration, proven manufacturing expertise, and commitment to recycling-integrated operations position it well to capture growing European and global demand for sustainable biopolymers. Completion of the France facility in 2027 is expected to solidify Futerro's position as a leading integrated PLA provider and enable significant growth in circular economy applications.
