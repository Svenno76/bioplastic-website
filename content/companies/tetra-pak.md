## Overview

Tetra Pak International SA is a Swedish multinational food packaging and processing company headquartered in Pully, Switzerland. Founded in 1951 in Lund, Sweden, Tetra Pak has grown to employ 24,546 people worldwide and generated revenue of $13.9 billion in 2024. The company is a particularly active member of European Bioplastics (EUBP), with Anke Hampel serving as Innovation and Sustainability Director representing Tetra Pak's commitment to sustainable packaging solutions.

As an industrial end user of bioplastics, Tetra Pak plays a crucial role in driving demand for bio-based polymers and advancing the commercialization of plant-based packaging materials. The company was the first in its industry to introduce packages made fully from plant-based renewable materials, establishing itself as a sustainability leader in the food packaging sector.

### Primary Materials

**Plant-Based Polyethylene**: Tetra Pak uses plant-based polymers produced from sugarcane for packaging material coatings and caps. The company sources Bonsucro-certified sustainable sugarcane-derived bioethanol, with Braskem supplying 100% Bonsucro certified volumes for Tetra Pak's plant-based solutions.

**Bio-Based Polymers**: Polymers used in Tetra Pak's food and beverage packaging are derived from plant-based materials like sugarcane, which are renewable when responsibly sourced.

**Renewable Materials**: Tetra Pak packages incorporate paperboard and plant-based polymer coatings, creating a predominantly renewable package structure.

**Traceable Plant-Based Polymers**: Tetra Pak was the first company to offer fully traceable plant-based polymers in packaging, ensuring transparency in the renewable materials supply chain.

### Market Segments

Tetra Pak serves the global food and beverage industry with sustainable packaging solutions:
- **Aseptic Packaging**: Long-life packaging for dairy, juice, and liquid foods
- **Dairy Products**: Milk, cream, yogurt drinks, and other dairy beverages
- **Juice and Beverages**: Fruit juices, nectars, and non-dairy beverages
- **Liquid Foods**: Soups, sauces, and other liquid food products
- **Sustainable Packaging**: Plant-based and renewable packaging solutions
- **Food Processing Equipment**: Processing solutions for liquid food manufacturers

### Plant-Based Packaging Innovations

**Tetra Rex Plant-Based Package**: In 2014, Tetra Pak was the first in its industry to introduce a package made fully from plant-based renewable materials. The Tetra Rex Plant-based package is manufactured with paperboard and sugarcane-based plastic, setting a new standard for sustainable packaging.

**Scale of Adoption**: Tetra Pak sold 13.5 billion plant-based packages in 2020 alone, demonstrating significant commercial success. In 2024, the company sold 25% more packages (11 billion) and 3.3% more caps (12.3 billion) made with plant-based plastic compared to 2023, showing continued growth in bio-based packaging adoption.

**Carbon Footprint Reduction**: A Tetra Brik Aseptic 1000 Edge LightCap 30 using plant-based polymers in the cap and packaging material coatings has a 37% lower carbon footprint compared to a standard package, demonstrating the environmental benefits of plant-based materials.

### Production Expansion

**Sugarcane-Based Coatings**: Tetra Pak has expanded production of aseptic cartons made with sugarcane-based polyethylene (PE) coatings. Cartons incorporating plant-based PE come with plant-based caps also derived from sugarcane, creating a fully integrated renewable polymer solution.

**Supply Chain**: The company works with suppliers like Braskem to secure certified sustainable bio-based polymers, ensuring environmental integrity throughout the supply chain.

### Environmental Leadership

Using plant-based polymers can reduce the packaging's impact on climate change compared to traditional packaging materials derived from fossil fuels. Tetra Pak's commitment to renewable materials aligns with global sustainability goals and demonstrates the commercial viability of bio-based polymers at industrial scale.

### Innovation and Sustainability Strategy

Tetra Pak continues to invest in renewable materials development, with Innovation and Sustainability Director Anke Hampel actively engaging with industry initiatives through EUBP membership. The company's vision is to create the world's most sustainable food package, made entirely from responsibly sourced renewable or recycled materials, fully recyclable, and carbon neutral.
