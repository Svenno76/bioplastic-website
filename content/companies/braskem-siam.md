## Overview

Braskem Siam Company Limited represents a transformative partnership between Braskem, the world's largest biopolymer producer, and SCG Chemicals, Thailand's leading petrochemical company. The joint venture is developing Asia's first and one of the world's largest bio-ethylene and bio-based polyethylene production facilities in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate in Rayong Province, Thailand.

With an investment of approximately THB 19.3 billion (USD 491 million) and a design capacity of 200,000 metric tons annually, the Braskem Siam facility will produce I'm green bio-based polyethylene from ethanol derived from renewable sugarcane feedstock. Expected completion by 2028, the facility positions Thailand as Asia's first bio-ethylene production center and demonstrates the strategic importance of Southeast Asia in global transitions toward renewable polymers and sustainable materials.

The project's environmental impact is substantial, with the potential to reduce net carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere by up to one million tons per year, supporting global climate change mitigation objectives while establishing Thailand as a manufacturing center for sustainable polymers serving Asia-Pacific and global markets.
