## Overview

BBCA (Biochemical) Group represents one of the world's largest integrated lactic acid and polylactic acid (PLA) manufacturers, occupying a pivotal position in China's transition toward renewable biochemical feedstocks and sustainable biopolymers. Headquartered in Bengbu, Anhui Province, BBCA operates a comprehensive biorefinery model converting renewable feedstocks—particularly agricultural biomass—into lactic acid, the critical building block for PLA production, and downstream PLA resins for global bioplastics markets.

With vertically-integrated production of lactic acid at 80,000-180,000 MT/year capacity and PLA production capacity ranging from 30,000-100,000 MT/year, BBCA operates at world-scale manufacturing across the complete value chain. The company's strategic partnerships with global biochemical leaders—Galactic (Belgium) and FUTERRO (Belgium)—position BBCA as a linchpin in Asia's expanding bioplastics infrastructure and a key supplier to converters and brand owners globally seeking sustainable PLA materials.

BBCA's business model exemplifies the renewable biochemical approach to bioplastics: converting agricultural feedstocks through biological fermentation into lactic acid, then polymerizing this bio-based intermediate into PLA resins with material properties suitable for diverse packaging, fiber, and consumer applications. This fully bio-based value chain, combined with world-scale production capacity and strategic global partnerships, establishes BBCA as a fundamental player in the global transition from petrochemical to bio-based plastic feedstocks.
