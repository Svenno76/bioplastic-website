## Overview

Uluu is an innovative Australian bioplastics company founded in 2015, pioneering a distinctive approach to sustainable materials through seaweed-based polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) production. Based in Melbourne with operations extending to Indonesia, Uluu has developed proprietary technology to transform cultivated seaweed into high-performance, fully biodegradable biopolymers through bacterial fermentation. The company has successfully raised AU$16 million in Series A funding (November 2025, approximately US$10.5 million) to accelerate commercialization and establish demonstration production facilities in Indonesia.

Uluu's distinctive combination of renewable seaweed feedstocks, marine-degradable biopolymers, climate-positive production, and social impact through partnership with women seaweed farmers in Indonesia positions it as a unique innovator in the Asia-Pacific bioplastics landscape, addressing both environmental sustainability and economic development objectives.
