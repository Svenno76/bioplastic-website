## Overview

The National Test Centre Circular Plastics (NTCP) is a not-for-profit independent test and research facility established at the end of 2018 to accelerate the circular objectives for plastics recycling. Located in Heerenveen, Netherlands, NTCP operates the first independent test centre in Europe with industrial-scale facilities for sorting and washing plastic waste. The facility was supported by the Dutch National Government, the province of Fryslan, and the Dutch Packaging Waste Fund (VROM).

## Core Mission and Functions

- **Independent Testing**: Objective, unbiased testing and research on plastics recycling processes
- **Process Improvement**: Research optimization of sorting and washing for plastic packaging
- **Design for Recycling**: Testing to improve product recyclability design
- **Technology Validation**: Evaluation of new sorting, washing, and recycling technologies
- **Industrial-Scale Research**: Testing at commercially relevant scale with real waste streams

## Facilities and Equipment

**Sorting System**:
- Unique pilot sorting line representative of industry but fully customizable for testing
- Tests efficiency of sorting specific packaging under realistic conditions
- Evaluates behavior of various plastic packaging types in sorting processes

**Washing and Processing**:
- Industrial-scale washing systems using equipment from leading manufacturers
- Capacity to process real heterogeneous waste streams
- Equipped with Lindner Washtech modular washing systems

**Testing and Analysis Capabilities**:
- Material characterization and quality assessment
- Contamination analysis and identification
- Process efficiency evaluation
- Long-term testing and research projects

## Services and Testing Focus

NTCP performs testing and research on:

- **Plastic Packaging Behavior**: How different packaging performs in industrial sorting
- **Recyclability Improvement**: Design modifications to enhance sorting efficiency
- **Process Optimization**: Sorting and washing process improvements
- **Material Quality**: Assessment of recycled plastic quality from different processes
- **Mechanical Recycling Routes**: Testing of conventional mechanical recycling processes
- **Chemical Recycling Routes**: Development and testing of chemical recycling alternatives

## Collaborative Approach

- Open to cooperation with all parties in the recycling value chain
- Provides objective results and independent advice
- Serves packaging manufacturers, recyclers, brand owners, and policymakers
- Supports development of better recyclable packaging solutions

## Industry Impact

NTCP contributes to circular economy objectives by:
- Identifying obstacles to plastic packaging recyclability
- Providing data for design improvements
- Validating new recycling technologies
- Supporting evidence-based policy development
- Reducing contamination in recycling streams

## Geographic Presence

Based in Heerenveen, Netherlands, at the center of Dutch plastics recycling infrastructure and innovation ecosystem.

## Strategic Importance

NTCP plays a critical role in the European circular economy transition by providing the testing infrastructure and research capabilities necessary to improve plastic recycling efficiency, reduce contamination, and advance both mechanical and chemical recycling technologies.
