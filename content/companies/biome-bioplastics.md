## Overview

Biome Bioplastics is a UK-based developer of biodegradable and bio-based plastics headquartered in Southampton. Building on more than 20 years of dedicated research and development, Biome Bioplastics has established itself as a leading innovator in high-performance, plant-based bioplastics that are 100% biodegradable and compostable while maintaining compatibility with conventional plastic processing methods.

The company's mission centers on producing bioplastics that can challenge the dominance of oil-based polymers and ultimately replace them completely. With operations from its Starpol Technology Centre facility in Marchwood Industrial Park, Biome Bioplastics develops and produces bioplastics specifically designed to overcome limitations of earlier-generation bioplastic materials.

### Primary Technologies and Materials
