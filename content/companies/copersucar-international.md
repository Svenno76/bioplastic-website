## Overview

Copersucar International stands as the world's largest sugar and ethanol trader, operating as a critical intermediary in Brazil's sugarcane commodity value chain while increasingly positioning itself as a strategic innovator in advanced biopolymer development from sugarcane feedstocks. Founded in 1966, Copersucar has evolved from a regional Brazilian sugar trading company into a global enterprise supplying sugar and ethanol to more than 70 countries worldwide, handling 12+ million metric tons of sugar and 17+ billion liters of ethanol annually.

Beyond its dominant position in commodity trading, Copersucar has emerged as a strategic participant in biopolymer research and development initiatives, positioning the company at the intersection of agricultural commodity supply and advanced materials innovation. The company's pioneering partnership with the Institute of Biomedical Sciences (ICB) of the University of São Paulo in the 1990s demonstrated early recognition of sugarcane's potential as a biopolymer feedstock. Through this and subsequent research collaborations, Copersucar has supported development of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)—a class of biodegradable biopolymers derived directly from sugarcane fermentation.

Copersucar's strategic positioning reflects understanding that sugarcane's value extends far beyond conventional sugar and ethanol commodities. As upstream biopolymer producers (Braskem, Raizen, emerging PHA developers) expand capacity, and downstream processors (ERT, specialty manufacturers) require consistent feedstock supply, Copersucar's scale and market position enable it to serve as a connector between agricultural resources and advanced materials development. The company's global trading platform and relationships across Brazilian sugarcane producers position it to support emerging biopolymer industry growth.
