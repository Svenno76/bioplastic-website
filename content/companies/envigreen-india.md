## Overview

Envigreen Biotech India Private Ltd represents an important node in India's emerging bioplastics ecosystem, pioneering the production of 100% biodegradable plastic substitutes derived entirely from natural starch and vegetable oil derivatives. Founded in 2016 by Ashwath Hegde, a Qatar-based Indian entrepreneur, Envigreen exemplifies the rapid emergence of bioplastics startups in India driven by the government's single-use plastic ban and growing sustainability awareness.

Operating from Bengaluru, India's technology and innovation hub, Envigreen has established production capacity of 1,000 metric tons annually, positioning itself among India's first-generation bioplastics manufacturers. The company's product focus on compostable bags—shopping bags, garbage bags, and carry bags—targets the massive market created by India's single-use plastic ban, which prohibits conventional plastic bags across the country.

Envigreen's technology platform emphasizes complete biodegradability through natural fermentation of starch and vegetable oil components, creating materials that decompose in standard composting environments without releasing harmful toxins or microplastics. This approach differs from partially bio-based or chemically-derived biodegradable materials, positioning Envigreen's products as "organic" substitutes that truly return to natural systems.

## Primary Technologies and Products

Envigreen's core technology centers on fermentation and chemical processing of natural starch and vegetable oil derivatives into complete biopolymers suitable for thin-film and injection-molded applications.

### Starch-Based Biopolymer Technology

Envigreen's primary material platform utilizes natural starch:
- **Feedstock sourcing:** Agricultural starch supplies (corn, cassava, potato)
- **Fermentation process:** Microbial fermentation for monomer synthesis
- **Polymerization:** Chemical synthesis to create complete polymers
- **Property optimization:** Additives and modifiers for specific applications
- **Quality assurance:** Compostability testing and certification

Starch-based polymers exhibit natural biodegradability in composting systems, where microbial populations quickly metabolize the polymer structure. Unlike synthetic polymers that persist in the environment for centuries, starch-based materials return to natural systems within months in proper composting conditions.

### Vegetable Oil Integration

Envigreen's differentiation involves integration of vegetable oil derivatives:
- **Oil feedstock:** Sourcing of sustainable vegetable oils
- **Chemical modification:** Processing to create polymer-compatible components
- **Blending:** Optimization of starch-oil ratios for performance
- **Property enhancement:** Improved mechanical properties vs. starch alone
- **Renewable content:** 100% natural and renewable materials

The combination of starch and vegetable oil creates fully organic biopolymers without synthetic additives, supporting Envigreen's positioning as a "purely natural" bioplastic.

### Product Portfolio

**Compostable Bags:**
- **Shopping bags:** Replacement for conventional plastic shopping bags
- **Garbage bags:** Trash bags suitable for composting along with organic waste
- **Carry bags:** Single-use bags for retail and commercial applications
- **Customizable designs:** Logos, colors, and sizes for branding

**Product Characteristics:**
- **Complete biodegradability:** 100% decomposition in composting systems
- **No toxins:** Absence of harmful chemicals or microplastics
- **Certified:** Third-party certification for compostability
- **Safe handling:** Non-toxic during production and use
- **Cost-competitive:** Pricing approaching conventional plastic

### Manufacturing Process

Envigreen's production process emphasizes natural fermentation and simple chemistry:
1. **Starch extraction:** Processing of agricultural feedstocks
2. **Oil sourcing:** Procurement of vegetable oils
3. **Fermentation:** Microbial conversion to intermediate compounds
4. **Blending:** Combination of starch and oil components
5. **Processing:** Film formation or molding into products
