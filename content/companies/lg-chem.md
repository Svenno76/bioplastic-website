## Overview

LG Chem is the largest Korean chemical company and a leading global bioplastics manufacturer headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. Founded in 1947 as the Lucky Chemical Industrial Corporation, the company has evolved into a diversified chemical and materials producer with 18,750 employees across 61 global sites. LG Chem manufactures a comprehensive range of bioplastics including PLA, PBAT, PHA, Bio-PA, and Bio-PE, serving multiple industries from packaging to automotive applications.

As a member of European Bioplastics (EUBP), LG Chem actively contributes to the development and commercialization of sustainable bio-based and biodegradable polymers. The company has received certification from DIN CERTCO, the German biodegradable materials international certification agency, confirming that its new materials meet industrial biodegradable European certification standards.

### Primary Materials

LG Chem produces and develops multiple types of bioplastics:

**PLA (Polylactic Acid)**: LG Chem is partnering with Archer Daniels Midlands (ADM) to establish a joint venture plant for PLA production, a biodegradable bioplastic made from renewable resources.

**PBAT (Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate)**: The company began construction of a PBAT plant with an annual production capacity of 50,000 tons, reaching full-scale mass production in 2024. PBAT is a biodegradable polymer used in flexible packaging and agricultural films.

**PHA (Polyhydroxyalkanoates)**: LG Chem is actively developing PHA, a naturally occurring biodegradable polymer produced through bacterial fermentation.

**Novel Biodegradable Materials**: LG Chem's Future Technology Research Center has successfully developed a wholly new bio-based polymer offering mechanical properties and transparency similar to conventional fossil-based materials like PP (polypropylene).

### Market Segments

LG Chem's bioplastics serve diverse market segments:
- **Packaging**: Compostable bags, flexible packaging, food packaging
- **Agriculture**: Mulch films, agricultural applications
- **Automotive**: Bio-based components and materials
- **Textiles**: Sustainable fiber applications
- **Consumer Goods**: Various biodegradable products
- **Industrial Applications**: Specialty biodegradable materials

### Key Innovations

LG Chem has developed the world's first biodegradable new material with enhanced molecular weight and polymerization technologies. The company teams up with TK Chemical to produce biodegradable plastics and continues to expand its bioplastics portfolio through strategic partnerships and R&D investments.

The company's bioplastics division is part of its broader Petrochemicals segment, which generated KRW 17.8 trillion in 2024, alongside its Energy Solutions, Advanced Materials, Life Sciences, and Farm Hannong divisions.

### Global Operations

LG Chem operates eight factories in South Korea and maintains a network of 29 business locations in 15 countries, including a holding company in China, 14 overseas manufacturing subsidiaries, five marketing subsidiaries, seven representative offices, and two R&D centers.
