## Overview

ENVIPLAST Biopolymer stands as Indonesia's pioneering manufacturer of bio-based and biodegradable polymer compounds, representing a critical node in Southeast Asia's emerging bioplastics industry. Established in 2009, ENVIPLAST has grown from startup innovation into a leading regional producer with significant export capabilities and global market penetration. The company specializes in producing compostable bioplastics derived from cassava starch, corn starch, and other renewable agricultural resources, positioning itself as a key enabler of Indonesia's transition toward sustainable materials and circular economy principles.

ENVIPLAST's core competency lies in transforming abundant Southeast Asian agricultural feedstocks into high-performance biodegradable polymers that serve diverse packaging and industrial applications. With production facilities in Indonesia and a commitment to renewable material sourcing, the company demonstrates the feasibility of indigenous bioplastics manufacturing at commercial scale within the region, reducing dependency on imported materials and establishing competitive advantage through feedstock proximity and cost efficiency.

The company's success reflects Indonesia's substantial agricultural capacity—particularly in cassava and corn production—and positions ENVIPLAST as a model for agricultural-to-bioplastics value chain development across Southeast Asia.

## Company History and Development

ENVIPLAST was founded in 2009 during an early period of bioplastics industry emergence, capitalizing on growing global awareness of plastic pollution and emerging regulatory pressures for sustainable materials. The company's founding coincided with Indonesia's recognition of its substantial agricultural surplus and the opportunity to convert agricultural products into advanced materials rather than commodity exports.

### Growth and Market Expansion

Since its establishment, ENVIPLAST has experienced consistent growth, expanding from initial domestic market focus to become a globally recognized bioplastics brand. The company's rapid international expansion reflects both the quality of its products and growing worldwide demand for biodegradable alternatives. ENVIPLAST now exports to over 50 countries across multiple continents, establishing itself as one of Southeast Asia's most recognized bioplastics brands globally.

### Regional Position

ENVIPLAST's emergence as Indonesia's leading bioplastics manufacturer coincided with the country's efforts to address plastic pollution and develop sustainable manufacturing capabilities. The company became instrumental in demonstrating that Indonesia could produce high-quality bioplastics domestically rather than relying solely on imports, supporting government objectives to build advanced materials industries and capture value within the biopolymer supply chain.

### Recognition and Industry Standing
