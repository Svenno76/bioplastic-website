## Overview

TIPA is a leading developer and manufacturer of fully compostable flexible packaging solutions headquartered in Israel and founded in 2010. The company has established itself as a global leader in high-barrier, home-compostable, and industrially-compostable films and multi-ply laminates that successfully replicate the performance characteristics of conventional plastic packaging while providing complete compostability within 6-12 months in appropriate facilities.

TIPA's technological achievement—creating flexible packaging with genuine barrier properties (moisture, oxygen, light) in fully compostable materials—has overcome a critical barrier in bioplastics adoption and positioned the company as essential to transitioning flexible packaging to sustainable alternatives.
