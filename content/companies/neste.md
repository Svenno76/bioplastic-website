## Overview

Neste Corporation is a Finnish oil refining and marketing company headquartered in Espoo, Finland, founded in 1948 as the State petrol company of Finland. Neste is the world's leading producer of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, and is a forerunner in developing renewable and circular feedstock solutions for polymers and chemicals. The company refines waste, residues and innovative raw materials into renewable fuels and sustainable feedstock for plastics and other materials.

### Primary Materials

Neste produces renewable hydrocarbons through its proprietary NEXBTL technology, which turns bio-based oils and fats into pure hydrocarbons that can be used as fuels or feedstock for plastics and chemicals production. The company's flagship product for the bioplastics industry is **Neste RE**, a drop-in feedstock produced by co-processing renewable raw materials such as used cooking oil together with fossil crude oil in its conventional oil refinery in Porvoo, Finland.

Key feedstock materials include:
- Renewable hydrocarbons from waste and residues
- Used cooking oil
- Animal fats
- Vegetable oils
- Other bio-based raw materials

### Market Segments

Neste serves multiple market segments through its renewable solutions:
- **Polymers and Chemicals**: Providing renewable feedstocks for bio-based plastic production
- **Packaging**: Enabling bio-based polyethylene and polypropylene production for food packaging
- **Renewable Fuels**: Leading producer of renewable diesel
- **Sustainable Aviation Fuel**: World's largest producer of SAF
- **Chemical Industry**: Supporting the transition to renewable chemical production

### Key Innovations

Neste and LyondellBasell announced an industry first in the production of bio-based plastics approved for food packaging through parallel production of bio-based polypropylene and bio-based low-density polyethylene on a commercial scale using renewable hydrocarbons derived from sustainable bio-based raw materials.

The company's NEXBTL technology enables the conversion of various waste and residue streams into high-quality renewable feedstocks, supporting the circular economy and reducing reliance on fossil-based raw materials.
