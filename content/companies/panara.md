## Overview

Panara is a Slovak biopolymer company headquartered in Nitra, Slovakia, specializing in the development, production, and commercialization of innovative polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and polylactic acid (PLA) blend materials. Founded in 2001, Panara has evolved from a materials research company into a commercial biopolymer producer with proprietary technology for creating 100% bio-based, biodegradable materials.

The company's flagship product, Nonoilen, represents a breakthrough in multi-component biopolymer formulation, combining PHA and PLA with bio-based modifiers and fillers to create materials that balance performance across diverse applications while maintaining full industrial and home composting compatibility. Panara's strategic positioning in Central Europe, combined with technical expertise developed through partnerships with Slovak research institutions, has made the company an attractive investment for Alpla Group, Europe's leading plastic packaging manufacturer, which acquired a significant minority stake to support technology scale-up and market expansion.
