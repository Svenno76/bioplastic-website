# ALPLA

ALPLA is a global leader in plastic packaging solutions and recycling technology, with a strong commitment to advancing the circular economy through innovative recycling processes and sustainable packaging development.

## Overview

Founded in 1955 in Hard, Austria, ALPLA has grown into a leading international packaging and recycling specialist. The company operates 14 recycling facilities globally and is at the forefront of developing advanced recycling technologies for food-grade applications. ALPLA's integrated approach combines packaging production with state-of-the-art recycling capabilities.

## Products and Services

### Recycled Materials
- **Recycled PET (rPET)**: Food-grade recycled polyethylene terephthalate for beverage and food packaging
- **Recycled HDPE (rHDPE)**: High-density polyethylene recycling, including pioneering food-safe solutions
- Packaging solutions across multiple industries

### Innovative Technologies
ALPLA is developing a patented solvent-based process for producing food-safe recycled HDPE, which represents a significant breakthrough as currently no certified process exists in the EU for food-grade HDPE recycled material.

## Capacity and Operations

Current global recycling capacity: 400,000 tonnes annually of rPET and rHDPE, with much of this output integrated into ALPLA's own packaging production.

## Innovation and Partnerships

### Food-Safe rHDPE Project
In collaboration with the National Test Centre Circular Plastics (NTCP) in the Netherlands, ALPLA has commenced a four-year pilot project to develop and scale food-safe recycled HDPE production. The project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Climate Policy and Green Growth, aims to achieve industrial scale by 2030, coinciding with the implementation of the EU's Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR).

Michael Heyde, Head of Technology Recycling Division at ALPLA, describes this highly efficient cleaning and processing technology as a "game changer" for the industry.

## Sustainability

ALPLA's circular economy approach directly addresses the growing demand for recycled content in packaging and facilitates compliance with upcoming EU regulations. The company has established a dedicated recycling company in the Netherlands specifically for advancing food-grade HDPE recycling technology.
