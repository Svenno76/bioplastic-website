## Overview

Aduro Clean Technologies is a Canadian chemical technology company headquartered in Sarnia, Ontario, that has developed a patented platform for transforming waste plastics and heavy oils into valuable chemical products and circular feedstocks. Founded in November 2012 by Ofer Vicus and Marcus Trygstad, Aduro operates at the intersection of sustainability and profitability, providing scalable solutions to address growing plastic waste challenges facing the global economy.

The company's core innovation, Hydrochemolytic™ Technology (HCT), represents a breakthrough in chemical recycling by breaking down long carbon chains in plastics and oils using water-based chemistry at moderate temperatures with specialized catalysts. This process converts difficult-to-recycle plastics—representing over 70% of municipal solid waste plastics—into high-value building blocks for chemical production, refining, and renewable energy applications.

With approximately 50-75 employees, Aduro has emerged as a publicly listed company, trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE: ACT) and Nasdaq (ADUR) following a 2024 uplisting. The company serves global markets through its technology licensing business model, partnering with major petrochemical companies, refining operations, and waste recycling organizations to scale Hydrochemolytic™ solutions internationally.

Under the leadership of CEO Ofer Vicus and newly appointed Chief Operating Officer David Weizenbach (effective July 2025), Aduro is pursuing an aggressive commercialization strategy focused on technology licensing and enabling circular economy transformation across the plastics industry.

### Primary Technologies and Focus

**Hydrochemolytic™ Technology (HCT)**: Aduro's flagship innovation represents a fundamentally different approach to plastic recycling compared to traditional pyrolysis or incineration methods.

**Technology Mechanism**:
- Uses water as a critical chemical agent, not merely as heat transfer medium
- Operates at moderate pressures and temperatures (significantly lower than pyrolysis processes)
- Employs proprietary catalysts to break long hydrocarbon chains in plastics and oils
- Transforms complex polymer structures into smaller, more valuable liquid products
- Process efficiency: 95% average usable product yield on polypropylene (PP) testing with over 240 test runs
- Extended capability: Up to 84% usable product yield on complex crosslinked polymers (XLPE)

**Advantages Over Conventional Recycling Methods**:

Compared to mechanical (physical) recycling:
- Processes contaminated feedstocks without extensive pre-treatment
- Produces virgin-quality outputs suitable for virgin material replacement
- Avoids degradation issues associated with multiple recycling cycles

Compared to traditional pyrolysis:
- Dramatically reduced post-treatment requirements (80-90% fewer purification steps)
- Eliminates nitrogen and oxygen contamination in feedstocks, common in pyrolysis products
- No requirement for costly hydrotreating post-processing
- Water-based process improves safety profile vs. high-temperature pyrolysis
- More energy-efficient operation at moderate pressures and temperatures

**Plastic Materials Processed**: HCT targets plastics representing 70% of municipal solid waste streams:
- Polyethylene (PE) - common in films, bags, and packaging
- Polypropylene (PP) - automotive, appliance, and industrial applications
- Polystyrene (PS) - foam products, electronics packaging
- Crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) - wire insulation, automotive components
- Complex, contaminated feedstocks unsuitable for mechanical recycling

**Product Outputs**: HCT converts waste plastics into valuable platform chemicals:
- Benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX) aromatics for chemical synthesis
- Aliphatic hydrocarbons for fuel and lubricant applications
- Recycled feedstocks for virgin plastic production (circular economy loop)
- Renewable feedstock for bio-based chemical production

**Recent Technological Advances**:

In January 2025, Aduro announced filing of a new patent application for a novel Next Generation Process (NGP) design that represents significant advances in commercial implementation:
- Utilizes widely available industrial equipment in novel configurations not previously envisioned
- Modular and scalable design enabling deployment across multiple facility types
- More efficient process implementation compared to previous designs
- Enables integration into existing petrochemical and refining infrastructure

### Market Segments and Applications

**Chemical Recycling and Waste Management**:
Aduro positions HCT as a critical solution for managing plastic waste streams that cannot be mechanically recycled due to contamination, degradation, or complex composition. The target market addresses approximately 330 million tons of plastic waste generated annually worldwide, with significant acceleration expected as single-use plastics face regulatory restrictions.

**Petrochemical and Refining Integration**:
The petrochemical industry represents a major addressable market. Aduro's technology enables:
- Integration into existing refinery infrastructure to process waste plastic feedstocks
- Reduction of fossil fuel extraction requirements by substituting recycled feedstocks
- Production of platform chemicals (BTX) for polymers, solvents, and specialty chemicals
- Support for energy companies transitioning business models toward circular economy

**Agricultural and Flexible Plastic Recycling**:
Significant opportunity in agricultural plastic waste—films, irrigation tubing, and equipment covers contaminated with soil and difficult to recycle. Aduro has partnered with Cleanfarms Inc. (Canada's agricultural plastic stewardship program) to evaluate HCT as a solution for farm plastic waste streams.

**Heavy Oil and Bitumen Upgrading**:
Aduro's technology extends beyond plastics to upgrading heavy crude oil and bitumen into lighter, more valuable products, particularly relevant for Canadian oil sands operations and heavy oil producers globally seeking to improve product quality and economics.
