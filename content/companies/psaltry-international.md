## Overview

Psaltry International Limited represents Nigeria's pioneer in agricultural-to-industrial value chain development, specifically leveraging cassava as a primary feedstock for multiple industrial applications. Founded in 2005 by entrepreneur Yemisi Iranloye with personal savings from agricultural commerce, Psaltry International has grown from entrepreneurial startup to become one of Nigeria's largest and most respected starch producers, with institutional significance extending to food security, rural development, and emerging bioplastics sector development.

Based in Ado-Awaye in Oyo State, Nigeria, Psaltry International operates integrated cassava processing infrastructure, sourcing fresh cassava roots from a network of 5,000+ smallholder farmers across the region. The company converts agricultural raw material into high-value food-grade industrial products, particularly cassava starch and flour, establishing a model for agricultural value addition within Nigeria's emerging bioeconomy.

The company's significance to the bioplastics sector extends beyond current operations: cassava starch and related products represent critical potential feedstocks for biodegradable polymer development. As global bioplastics production increasingly focuses on agricultural feedstock utilization, Psaltry International's existing infrastructure, supply chains, and industrial processing capabilities position it strategically for potential bioplastics compound and material development.
