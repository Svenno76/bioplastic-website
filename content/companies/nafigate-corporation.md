## Overview

NAFIGATE Corporation is a Czech biotechnology and nanotechnology company headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, specializing in innovative bioplastic production technologies based on waste valorization. Founded in 2011, NAFIGATE represents a research-driven approach to sustainable polymer development, leveraging Czech scientific excellence and biotechnology expertise to create commercial applications from laboratory innovations.

The company operates proprietary Hydal technology, which converts waste cooking oil into high-purity polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers through fermentation and polymer isolation processes. NAFIGATE's work combines advanced microbial biotechnology with materials science to address both the waste stream problem and the need for certified biodegradable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. The company's research partnerships with Brno University of Technology and the Czech Academy of Sciences provide scientific depth and credibility to its technology platform.

## Primary Technologies and Materials

**Hydal Technology Platform**
NAFIGATE's proprietary Hydal technology represents a breakthrough in converting low-value waste streams into high-value biopolymers. The process uses:
- Used cooking oil as feedstock (valorizing significant waste streams)
- Microbial fermentation processes to convert lipids into PHA
- Advanced polymer isolation and purification methods
- Production of high-purity P3HB and other PHA variants

**PHA Production from Waste Oils**
- Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) sourced from renewable, waste-based feedstocks
- Avoidance of food-crop competition (uses waste cooking oil, not virgin feedstocks)
- Reduced production costs compared to synthetic routes
- Inherent biodegradability in marine and terrestrial environments
- Complete home and industrial composting compatibility

**P3HB Polymers**
- Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) production through optimized fermentation
- Applications in cosmetics as microplastic particle replacements
- Suitable for packaging applications requiring high biodegradability
- Natural origin appeals to premium market segments

**Nanofiber Technologies**
Beyond bioplastics, NAFIGATE develops nanofiber applications for:
- Water treatment and air filtration
- Biomedical applications
- Advanced material composites

## Market Segments and Applications

**Cosmetics and Personal Care**
NAFIGATE has pioneered the use of PHA and P3HB as alternatives to synthetic microplastics in cosmetic formulations. The company markets natural, biodegradable microparticle replacements that:
- Provide visual appeal and sensory experience similar to conventional microplastics
- Decompose naturally in aquatic and terrestrial environments
- Meet regulatory requirements eliminating synthetic microplastics
- Command premium pricing in eco-conscious consumer markets

**Packaging and Food Contact**
PHA biopolymers from Hydal technology serve packaging applications including:
- Flexible films and sheets for food packaging
- Rigid containers for food and beverage
- Single-use food service items
- Agricultural applications and mulch films

**Specialty Materials**
- Biomedical applications leveraging PHA biocompatibility
- Advanced polymer blends and compounds
- Specialty applications in textiles and coatings

## Production Facilities and Technology

**Prague Research and Development Center**
Located in Praha 9, the headquarters facility serves as the company's innovation hub and administrative center. The facility houses core research team and coordinates technology development across the organization.

**Czech Academy of Sciences Integration**
The Microbiological Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences hosts operational facilities for NAFIGATE's PHA production using the Hydal technology. This integration with Czech Academy of Sciences provides:
- Access to world-class research infrastructure
- Validation of biotechnological processes
- Credibility and scientific rigor to development efforts

**Brno University of Technology Partnership**
Collaborative research with the Faculty of Chemistry at Brno University of Technology has produced:
- Original biotechnological innovations underlying Hydal technology
- Patent-protected processes for converting waste cooking oil to PHA
- Ongoing material science optimization and product development
- Student and researcher involvement in commercialization

## Industry Position and Recognition

**Technological Awards and Recognition**
NAFIGATE has received significant international recognition for innovation:
- **Frost & Sullivan Technology Innovation Award 2015**: Recognition of breakthrough Hydal technology
- **Eastern European Business Elite Award 2016**: Acknowledgment of business excellence and regional leadership
- **International Awards**: Multiple prizes for technological and environmental innovation

**European Bioplastics Membership**
NAFIGATE maintains active membership in European Bioplastics, the industry association representing manufacturers, converters, and organizations in the bioplastics sector. This membership reflects commitment to industry standards, sustainability practices, and market development.

**Research Partnerships**
- Brno University of Technology Faculty of Chemistry
- Czech Academy of Sciences Microbiological Institute
- Slovak University of Technology (collaboration with Panara on material development)
- International collaborations in biotechnology and polymer science

## Regional Significance

NAFIGATE represents Czech biotechnology excellence and innovation in the Eastern European bioplastics sector. The company demonstrates the region's capacity for cutting-edge research commercialization and sustainable technology development. Czech Republic's strong engineering and scientific education base, combined with supportive regulatory environment for innovation, has enabled NAFIGATE to develop and scale proprietary biotechnology.

The company's success positioning waste cooking oil processing as a profitable business model has attracted regional interest and influenced other Central European biotechnology companies' interest in valorization-based bioplastic production. NAFIGATE serves as a model for research-driven commercialization in the broader Eastern European innovation ecosystem.

## Sustainability and Environmental Credentials

**Waste Stream Valorization**
Hydal technology directly addresses the significant environmental challenge of used cooking oil waste. Used cooking oils accumulate in food service operations, restaurants, and food processing facilities. NAFIGATE's technology:
- Converts environmental liability into valuable feedstock
- Prevents improper oil disposal and environmental contamination
- Reduces dependency on virgin oil crops and food-competing feedstocks
- Creates economic incentives for proper waste collection and recycling

**Certified Biodegradability**
PHA products from Hydal technology are certified for:
- Industrial composting (EN 13432 compliant)
- Home composting certification where applicable
- Marine environment biodegradation
- Soil environment degradation

**Microplastic Elimination**
NAFIGATE's P3HB cosmetic applications directly support regulatory objectives to eliminate synthetic microplastics from consumer products. By offering functionally equivalent, biodegradable alternatives, NAFIGATE enables cosmetics companies to meet EU regulations while maintaining product performance.

## Financial Profile and Funding

**Company Structure**
NAFIGATE operates as a privately held, research-driven biotech company focused on technology commercialization rather than large-scale production. The company model emphasizes R&D excellence and licensing or partnership opportunities.

**Funding and Investment**
As a technology company, NAFIGATE has attracted investment and partnership support from:
- European research funding programs
- Innovation funding mechanisms
- Strategic partnerships with material companies and cosmetics manufacturers
- Academic institutional support through Czech Academy of Sciences integration

**Business Model**
The company pursues multiple revenue streams:
- Direct sales of PHA and P3HB materials to converters and manufacturers
