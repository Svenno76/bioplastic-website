## Overview

Carbon Cell develops a patent-pending, plastic-free expandable foam made from biochar and natural binders as a carbon-negative alternative to conventional polymer foams like EPS, EPP, and PUR/PIR. The material is lightweight, strong, thermally insulative, fully compostable, and serves as a drop-in replacement for existing manufacturing lines, locking in carbon for centuries. It targets persistent plastic waste issues in foams used for packaging and insulation.
