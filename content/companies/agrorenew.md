## Overview

AgroRenew is an innovative U.S.-based bioplastics company headquartered in Vincennes, Indiana, specializing in the production of 100% biodegradable PHA (polyhydroxyalkanoate) bioplastics derived from agricultural crop waste. Co-founded by Katie L. Southern (Chief Science Officer) and Brian Southern (CEO), the company addresses a critical intersection of agricultural waste management and sustainable materials production.

The company's core innovation centers on transforming melon rinds and other crop waste from Knox County farms into high-quality PHA biopolymers. Rather than competing with food production for feedstocks, AgroRenew leverages otherwise unused agricultural byproducts, creating a circular bioeconomy model that benefits farmers, the environment, and the bioplastics industry.

### Agricultural Feedstock Technology

**Crop Waste Utilization**: AgroRenew's proprietary technology converts agricultural crop waste—particularly melon rinds rich in cellulose and organic polymers—into resin polymers suitable for bioplastic production.

**Local Sourcing Model**: By sourcing feedstocks from local melon farms in Knox County, AgroRenew creates a "win-win-win" scenario:
- Farmers receive additional revenue for previously discarded biomass
- Agricultural waste is diverted from landfills
- Sustainable raw materials are produced locally

### Production Facility and Capacity

**$83 Million Facility**: AgroRenew broke ground on an $83 million manufacturing facility designed to establish industrial-scale PHA production capacity in Knox County, Indiana.

**Production Scale**: The facility's design enables rapid production cycles—capable of manufacturing in hours the volume of bioplastic material that current global bioplastics companies produce annually, positioning AgroRenew as a major competitor in bioplastics manufacturing.

### Primary Materials and Technologies

**PHA from Renewable Feedstocks**: AgroRenew produces polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers sourced from renewable agricultural materials including watermelon, cantaloupe, and pumpkin waste.

**Fermentation-Based Production**: The company utilizes microorganism fermentation processes to convert crop sugars and carbohydrates into PHA polymers with properties comparable to conventional plastics.

### Market Segments

- **Packaging**: Flexible and rigid packaging applications requiring biodegradability
- **Agriculture**: Mulch films, soil amendments, and agricultural application films
- **Food Service**: Food containers, serviceware, and food contact compliant applications
- **Consumer Products**: Applications benefiting from fully biodegradable materials

### Industry Position and Market Leadership

**Largest US Bioplastics Manufacturing Market Share**: AgroRenew has been recognized as holding the largest market share in US bioplastics manufacturing as of 2025-2026, reflecting rapid scaling and competitive positioning.

**Scale-Up Achievement**: The company has successfully transitioned from development to industrial-scale production, achieving manufacturing volumes competitive with established bioplastics producers.

**Agricultural Community Integration**: Strong relationships with regional farming communities and agricultural industry support validate business model and sustainability credentials.
