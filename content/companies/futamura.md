## Overview

Futamura Chemical Company Limited is a major producer of polymeric and cellulose films headquartered in Nagoya, Japan. Founded in 1950, the company has established itself as a leading manufacturer of regenerated cellulose products, particularly the NatureFlex and Cellophane film brands. Following the acquisition of Innovia Films' cellulose business in July 2016, Futamura expanded its global footprint with production sites in Japan, the UK, and the USA. The company employs approximately 1,500 people worldwide and generates revenue of $451.7 million.

As an active member of European Bioplastics (EUBP), Futamura plays a significant role in advancing compostable packaging solutions. Andy Sweetman from Futamura serves on the EUBP Board as of June 2024, demonstrating the company's leadership commitment to the bioplastics industry.

### Key Innovations

**First Compostable Ovenable Film**: In October 2019, Futamura launched what it described as the "first compostable ovenable film," enabling food products to be cooked in their packaging and then composted after use. This innovation addresses the growing demand for convenient, sustainable packaging solutions.

**NatureFlex Cellulose Film Technology**: Futamura has refined and optimized regenerated cellulose film production over many decades, resulting in a sustainable packaging material that combines renewable content, compostability, and high performance.
