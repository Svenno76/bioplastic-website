## Overview

The RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) is Japan's leading research institute conducting pioneering research on advanced bioplastic materials. Established as a major research center within RIKEN, Japan's flagship research institution, CEMS focuses on developing next-generation bioplastics including supramolecular polymers, ocean-degradable materials, and plant-based alternatives. The center's research is directed by Takuzo Aida and has produced breakthrough innovations in environmentally conscious materials science.

## Core Research Areas

### Supramolecular Plastics Technology

CEMS has developed revolutionary supramolecular plastics held together by reversible interactions:

- **Composition**: Ionic monomers including sodium hexametaphosphate (food-grade additive) and guanidinium ion-based monomers
- **Properties**: Non-toxic, non-flammable, thermoplastic characteristics
- **Customization**: Variable hardness and tensile strength through monomer variation
- **Ocean Degradability**: Fully degradable in seawater without microplastic residue

### Applications Development

Different formulations enable:
- **Hard plastics**: Scratch-resistant applications
- **Rubber-like materials**: Flexible, silicone-like properties
- **Weight-bearing plastics**: High tensile strength applications
- **Low-tensile flexible plastics**: Flexible film and coating applications

## Breakthrough Innovations

**Revolutionary Ocean-Safe Plastic (2024-2025)**:
- Plant cellulose-based bioplastic developed by Takuzo Aida's team
- Fully degradable in marine environments
- Zero microplastics generation
- Recyclable and reshapable at temperatures above 120°C
- Comparable or superior performance to conventional plastics

**Key Publication**: Reported in Science (November 22, 2024) and Journal of the American Chemical Society (2025)
