## Overview

The RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science (CEMS) conducts research on advanced bioplastic materials, focusing on biopolyesters produced by microorganisms and novel polymers from biomass resources. Their work includes molecular design methodologies to predict properties and efficient synthesis technologies for high-performance, environmentally conscious bioplastics. Recent developments feature supramolecular plastics that are strong, recyclable, and fully degradable in seawater to prevent m...
