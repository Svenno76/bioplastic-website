## Overview

Sukano AG is a family-owned company headquartered in Schindellegi, Switzerland, founded in 1988. The company is a world leader in the development and production of additive and colour masterbatches and compounds for polyester and specialty resins. Sukano plays a crucial role in the bioplastics supply chain by providing specialized masterbatch solutions that enable processors to optimize the performance and aesthetics of bio-based and biodegradable materials.

With manufacturing facilities strategically located in Switzerland, the USA, and Malaysia, Sukano maintains a global presence while delivering technical expertise and innovative solutions to bioplastics manufacturers worldwide.

### Primary Materials

**PLA Masterbatches**: Sukano offers a comprehensive range of masterbatches specifically designed for PLA (Polylactic Acid) processing, addressing the unique requirements of this bio-based and compostable polymer. These masterbatches enable processors to achieve desired colors and functional properties while maintaining PLA's biodegradability.

**Antiblock Additives for BOPLA**: Sukano has developed specialized antiblock additives for BOPLA (Biaxially Oriented PLA) used in compostable plastic packaging. These additives prevent film layers from sticking together during processing and use, enabling efficient production and improved end-use performance.

**Colour Masterbatches**: Full spectrum of color solutions for bioplastics and polyester resins, enabling brand owners to achieve desired aesthetics in sustainable packaging.

**Additive Masterbatches**: Functional additives that enhance processing, mechanical properties, barrier performance, and end-use characteristics of bioplastics.

**Compounds for Specialty Resins**: Custom formulations for specific bioplastic applications requiring tailored property profiles.

### Market Segments

Sukano's masterbatch and compound solutions serve diverse industries:
- **Packaging**: The largest segment, including flexible and rigid packaging, food contact applications, and compostable packaging
- **Durable Goods**: Long-lasting products requiring enhanced performance characteristics
- **Building and Construction**: Bio-based materials for construction applications
- **Healthcare**: Specialized solutions for medical and pharmaceutical packaging
- **Textiles**: Fibers and fabrics incorporating bio-based polymers
