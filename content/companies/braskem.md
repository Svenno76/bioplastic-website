## Overview

Braskem is a leading petrochemical company headquartered in São Paulo, Brazil, and represents one of Latin America's major chemical and petrochemical enterprises. Founded in 2002 through the merger of several Brazilian petrochemical producers, Braskem has grown to become the world's largest producer of bio-based polyethylene (I'm green™ bio-PE) derived from renewable sugarcane ethanol. With approximately 9,000 employees and operations in Brazil, the United States, and Europe, Braskem is a publicly listed company on the B3 (Brazilian stock exchange).

Braskem's pioneering work in commercializing bio-based polyethylene has established the company as a global leader in sustainable petrochemicals. The I'm green™ brand represents Braskem's commitment to offering drop-in replacements for conventional polyethylene that provide identical performance characteristics while leveraging renewable resources.

### Bio-PE Technology and Production

**I'm green™ Bio-PE**: Braskem's flagship bioplastic product is 100% bio-based polyethylene produced from sugarcane ethanol. This material offers:
- Identical properties to conventional PE, making it a true "drop-in" replacement
- Complete compatibility with existing PE processing equipment and supply chains
- Renewable content from sugarcane, a rapidly renewable crop
- Significant carbon footprint reduction compared to fossil-based PE
- Certification from major sustainability bodies

**Production Expansion**: Braskem has invested significantly in expanding bio-PE production capacity. As of May 2025, Braskem operates production with 275,000 tons per year capacity of green ethylene—37% above the original 2010 project capacity. The company is pursuing further expansion with plans to develop new biopolymer products, including bio-based polypropylene.

**Future Goals**: Braskem has announced ambitious plans to reach 1 million tons of annual production capacity for bioproducts and bioattributed products by 2030, demonstrating strong commitment to sustainable polymers.

### Primary Materials

**Bio-based Polyethylene (I'm green™)**: Braskem's primary focus, produced from sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, offering identical performance to conventional PE with renewable sourcing.

**Conventional Polyethylene**: Traditional PE products for standard applications.

**Polypropylene**: Both conventional and bio-based development initiatives.

### Market Segments

Braskem's bio-PE and other products serve:
- **Packaging**: Flexible and rigid packaging for food, beverages, and consumer products
- **Automotive**: Components and parts requiring high durability
- **Textiles**: Fibers and fabrics using bio-based content
- **Consumer Goods**: Household products and personal care applications
