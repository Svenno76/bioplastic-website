Northeast Forestry University, located in Harbin, China, is actively involved in bioplastics research and development. The university collaborates with Shenyang University of Chemical Technology on developing high-strength, biodegradable plastics from bamboo cellulose using a non-toxic alcohol solvent process.

## Research Focus

The university's bioplastics research demonstrates that bamboo cellulose-based materials can match or exceed petroleum-based plastics in:
- Tensile strength
- Thermal stability
- Moldability

## Key Achievements

- Biodegrades fully in soil within 50 days
- Retains 90% strength after recycling
- Suitable for high-performance applications

### Primary Materials

Bamboo cellulose-based bioplastic

### Market Segments

Automotive, appliances, construction, packaging, engineering

### Collaboration

- **Partner**: Shenyang University of Chemical Technology
