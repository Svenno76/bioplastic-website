## Overview

Urobo Biotech represents a transformative approach to the critical challenge of bioplastic waste management in Africa and globally. Founded in June 2023 as a pioneering spin-out from Stellenbosch University in South Africa and the University of Padua in Italy, Urobo Biotech has emerged as a leader in developing enzymatic and microbiological solutions to convert end-of-life bioplastics into high-value bioproducts. The company's innovative technology addresses a fundamental gap in the bioplastics industry: while bioplastics are designed to be compostable and biodegradable, they require specific environmental conditions that are not always available at scale, creating waste management challenges.

Based in Stellenbosch, South Africa, Urobo Biotech's mission is to resolve the growing problem of bioplastic waste by developing proprietary biotechnologies that selectively break down mixed bioplastic waste streams without requiring prior sorting. This waste-to-value approach transforms a disposal problem into an economic opportunity, enabling the production of valuable fine chemicals, biofuels, and other high-value compounds from bioplastic feedstocks.

## Technology Platform and Innovation

Urobo Biotech's core technology is built on the groundbreaking PhD research of Dr. Wessel Myburgh, conducted at both Stellenbosch University and the University of Padua. The technology platform represents a significant innovation in biotechnology application to circular economy challenges.

### Enzymatic and Microbiological Degradation

**Core Technology Approach:**
- Development of proprietary enzymes that selectively degrade biopolymers (PLA, PBAT, PHAs) in mixed waste streams
- Application of microbial communities engineered to convert bioplastic polymers into metabolic intermediates
- Optimization of degradation conditions to maximize conversion efficiency and product yield
- Integration of enzymatic and microbial processes for complete polymer breakdown
- Patent-pending technology providing competitive advantages and intellectual property protection

**Key Advantages:**
- No requirement for prior sorting of mixed bioplastic waste
- Selective degradation without affecting other waste components
- High conversion efficiency and product specificity
