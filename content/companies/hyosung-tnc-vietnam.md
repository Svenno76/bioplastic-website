## Overview

Hyosung TNC represents a major strategic investment in Southeast Asia's advanced materials manufacturing capacity, establishing Vietnam as the world's first location for a fully vertically-integrated bio-spandex production system. The South Korean company is investing USD 1 billion to develop and scale Bio-BDO (bio-based butanediol) production using proven fermentation technology licensed from Geno, followed by conversion to spandex fibers for global textiles and apparel markets.

Beginning in the first half of 2026, Hyosung TNC will commence commercial production of 50,000 metric tons annually of Bio-BDO—a critical intermediate chemical for spandex fiber production—manufactured through fermentation of sugars derived from renewable sugarcane. The company has ambitious expansion plans targeting 200,000 MT/year total capacity across multiple facilities by 2030+, positioning Vietnam and Hyosung as global leaders in renewable spandex fiber technology and production.

By establishing the world's first vertically-integrated bio-spandex system from fermentation to fiber production, Hyosung TNC demonstrates a transformative approach to textile industry sustainability, offering 90% carbon avoidance vs. conventional coal-based BDO production and supporting global textile industry transitions toward renewable materials and circular bioeconomy principles.
