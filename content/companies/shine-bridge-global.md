## Overview

Shine Bridge Global Inc. represents a dynamic approach to African agricultural value chain development, focused on transforming Nigerian cassava into high-value food products and emerging industrial applications. Founded in 2018 by Dr. Tony Bello, a Nigerian-American entrepreneur and food scientist, Shine Bridge Global operates at the intersection of agricultural development, food innovation, and emerging bioplastics opportunities across Nigeria and global markets.

The company operates through a dual-base model: principal offices in the United States managing market development and product innovation, combined with operational bases across Nigeria leveraging direct cassava sourcing and processing capabilities. With 4,000+ acres of integrated cassava farming and daily processing capacity approaching 100 tonnes, Shine Bridge Global has emerged as a significant player in Nigeria's cassava value chain modernization and represents a strategic bridge connecting Nigerian agricultural resources to global markets.

The company's significance extends beyond current food product focus: cassava represents one of Africa's most abundant agricultural resources (Nigeria produces 60+ million tonnes annually), with emerging recognition of its bioplastics potential. As global companies and African governments increasingly focus on biodegradable polymer development, Shine Bridge Global's cassava expertise, processing infrastructure, and supply chain capabilities position it strategically for participation in the emerging continental bioplastics sector.
