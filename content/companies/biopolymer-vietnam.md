## Overview

Biopolymer Vietnam represents a pioneering innovation in sustainable materials development, establishing the world's first and only commercial specialization in coffee grounds-based bioplastics. Launched in early 2021 by Veritas Vietnam Joint Stock Company, Biopolymer Vietnam transforms the environmental challenge of global coffee waste into high-value biodegradable consumer products through an innovative material platform that combines 60% coffee grounds waste with conventional polymers to create functional, compostable materials.

Operating from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's commercial hub, Biopolymer Vietnam serves an underexploited opportunity at the intersection of global coffee consumption waste and bioplastics innovation. The company's product portfolio spans from consumer goods (cutlery, cups, containers, mugs, pens, masks) to specialty applications, with products exported to over 50 countries and territories globally. By addressing a genuine environmental problem—6 million tons of coffee grounds discarded annually worldwide—and converting waste into functional materials, Biopolymer Vietnam demonstrates innovation in the circular bioeconomy and environmental value creation.

The company's unique focus on coffee grounds differentiation and its first-mover advantage in this material category position Biopolymer Vietnam as an innovator in specialty bioplastics and a model for waste valorization and circular economy development in Southeast Asia.
