## Overview

Stora Enso is a leading provider of renewable products in packaging, biomaterials, wooden construction and paper, headquartered in both Helsinki, Finland and Stockholm, Sweden. Formed in 1998 through the merger of the Finnish company Enso Oyj and the Swedish company Stora AB, the company employs approximately 19,000 people in more than 35 countries worldwide. With annual revenue of €9 billion in 2024, Stora Enso is at the forefront of transforming the industry from fossil-based materials to renewable solutions.

Stora Enso is pioneering the development of PEF (polyethylene furanoate), a next-generation bio-based plastic that challenges conventional PET in packaging applications. The company's proprietary FuraCore technology represents a breakthrough in converting renewable feedstocks into advanced chemical building blocks for bioplastics and specialty materials.

### Primary Materials

**FDCA (Furan-dicarboxylic acid)**: Stora Enso has developed a proprietary process called FuraCore for converting fructose into FDCA via the precursor HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural). FDCA is an organic chemical compound that occurs in nature and is a key building block for renewable materials.

**HMF (5-hydroxymethylfurfural)**: The precursor to FDCA, HMF is a key chemical intermediate with special characteristics and reactivity that make it an important ingredient in the industrial production of polymers, including resins, additives, coatings and fuel additives. HMF is often called a "sleeping giant" due to its enormous anticipated market potential.

**PEF (Polyethylene furanoate)**: A bio-based plastic for packaging applications that is being developed as a sustainable alternative to PET. PEF offers superior barrier properties and is produced from renewable feedstocks rather than fossil fuels.

**Specialty Polymers and Derivatives**: FDCA enables the production of various specialty polymers including coatings, resins, and advanced materials with enhanced performance characteristics.

### Market Segments

Stora Enso's bio-based chemical building blocks serve multiple market segments:
- **Packaging**: PEF as a sustainable alternative to PET for bottles and containers
- **Biomaterials**: Renewable materials for various applications
- **Specialty Polymers**: High-performance coatings and resins
- **Fuel Additives**: HMF derivatives for renewable fuel formulations
- **Sustainable Packaging Materials**: Next-generation bio-based packaging
- **Circular Economy Solutions**: Renewable alternatives to fossil-based materials

### FuraCore Technology

Stora Enso's proprietary FuraCore process converts fructose (derived from renewable biomass) into FDCA and HMF through an innovative chemical pathway. The technology has been established at a pilot plant in Langerbrugge near Ghent in Belgium, where the process is being tested and validated for commercial scale-up. Commercialization is planned for 2026, marking a significant milestone in the transition from fossil-based to renewable chemical building blocks.

### Key Innovations

**PEF Development**: Stora Enso is investing significantly in PEF bioplastics production, with PEF positioned to challenge conventional PET in packaging applications. The investment in the pilot plant demonstrates the company's commitment to building a new bioplastics ecosystem based on renewable resources.

**Partnerships**: Stora Enso and Kolon Industries launched a partnership to build a new bioplastics ecosystem, focusing on developing and commercializing PEF-based packaging solutions for global markets.

**Market Potential**: The potential of HMF extends beyond FDCA production, with applications in polymers, resins, additives, coatings, and fuel additives representing an enormous market opportunity for renewable chemistry.

### Sustainability Leadership

Stora Enso's focus on renewable materials aligns with global sustainability goals and the circular economy. By transforming the industry from fossil-based to bio-based materials, the company contributes to reducing carbon emissions and dependence on non-renewable resources.
