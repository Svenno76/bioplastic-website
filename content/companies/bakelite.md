## Overview

Bakelite represents a historically significant chapter in the development of synthetic plastics and materials science. Invented in 1907 by Belgian-American chemist Leo Baekeland, Bakelite was the world's first fully synthetic plastic—a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin that could be manufactured industrially and offered properties superior to natural materials for many applications.

While Bakelite is not a modern bioplastic by contemporary definition (not biobased or biodegradable), it holds historical importance as one of the earliest attempts to move beyond natural materials and petroleum-derived polymers. This profile documents Bakelite's historical significance, manufacturing heritage, and place in plastics history, recognizing its role in the evolution toward more sustainable material alternatives.
