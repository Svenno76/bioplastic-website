## Overview

ERT Bioplastics, trading as Earth Renewable Technologies, represents Brazil's leading manufacturer of compostable food serviceware products, specializing in the transformation of premium PLA biopolymers into high-quality, industrially compostable food service products. Based in São Paulo, ERT has positioned itself as a critical link in the value chain connecting upstream biopolymer producers (notably TotalEnergies Corbion through the Luminy® brand) with downstream food service, quick service restaurant (QSR), and institutional catering markets.

The company's emergence reflects growing market demand for sustainable food service solutions in Brazil and expanding internationally. ERT's product lines, particularly the CascaBrasil brand launched in partnership with Strawplast, represent the first 100% compostable food service product collection manufactured entirely in Brazil. This achievement demonstrates Brazil's capacity for advanced biopolymer processing and transformation into consumer-facing products, moving the country beyond raw biopolymer production into higher-value applications.

ERT's business model represents a critical segment of the bioplastics value chain—the conversion of bulk PLA resin into finished consumer products suitable for food contact applications. By establishing domestic manufacturing capacity for food serviceware, ERT reduces Brazil's dependence on imports while creating employment and building consumer awareness of industrial composting solutions. The company's partnership with TotalEnergies Corbion ensures reliable access to premium-grade PLA materials certified for food contact and industrial composting.
