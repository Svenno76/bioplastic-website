## Overview

Avantium is a leading chemical technology company headquartered in Amsterdam, Netherlands, dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative plant-based polymers and renewable chemistry solutions. Founded in February 2000 as a spin-off from Shell, Avantium has established itself at the forefront of biopolymer innovation. With a team of 300+ professionals, the company focuses on replacing fossil-based materials with sustainable, renewable alternatives that offer superior performance characteristics.

Avantium's vision centers on "Renewable Aromatics," leveraging advanced biotechnology and chemistry to transform plant-based sugars into high-performance polymers. The company's flagship technology, PEF (polyethylene furanoate), represents a revolutionary 100% plant-based, fully recyclable polymer that offers superior performance to conventional PET, positioning Avantium as a key player in advancing circular economy solutions.

### Primary Technologies and Products

**PEF (Polyethylene Furanoate)**: Avantium's flagship biopolymer technology, also marketed as Releaf®
- 100% plant-based polymer derived from renewable resources
- Fully recyclable and compostable (in appropriate facilities)
- Superior performance compared to conventional PET
- Offers enhanced barrier properties, particularly to oxygen and CO2
- Lower environmental footprint than fossil-based plastics
- Compatible with existing PET recycling infrastructure for circular loops
- Targeted for commercial production launch in 2026

**FDCA (2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid)**: A key building block chemical
- Produced from plant-based feedstocks (particularly from C5/C6 sugars)
- Starting material for PEF and other biopolymers
- Flagship FDCA plant in Delfzijl, Netherlands (operational since 2021)
- Production capacity expansion planned to support growing PEF demand

### Production Facilities and Infrastructure

**Amsterdam Headquarters**: Main corporate office and center for strategic planning and business development.

**Geleen, Netherlands**: Multiple pilot plants for technology development and optimization.

**Delfzijl, Netherlands**: Flagship FDCA production plant, representing Avantium's first full-scale bioplastics production facility. Originally expected to commence operations in 2024, the facility is currently in advanced commissioning with full production start-up and product sales planned for the second half of 2026. Recent construction-related piping issues with titanium welds required additional remediation work.

**R&D Laboratories**: Advanced research facilities in Amsterdam conducting continuous innovation in chemistry and materials science.

### Market Segments and Applications

Avantium's PEF technology targets multiple high-value markets:
- **Packaging**: Bottles for beverages, food packaging, and rigid containers
- **Food & Beverage**: Premium packaging for carbonated beverages and food products
- **Textiles**: Polyester fibers and fabric applications
- **Cosmetics**: Packaging for personal care and cosmetic products
- **Circular Economy**: Designed for integration into existing PET recycling systems

### Technology Development and Partnerships

Avantium collaborates with leading companies across the value chain to commercialize PEF technology. The company has announced partnerships with major packaging manufacturers, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies, and recycling companies to develop circular PEF solutions. Strategic offtake agreements are in place with several major brands for PEF supply upon commercial production start.

### Commercialization Timeline

- **2000**: Company founded as Shell spin-off
- **2021**: FDCA demonstration plant operational in Delfzijl
- **2024**: Full-scale FDCA Flagship Plant construction completed with commissioning initiated
- **2026**: Target for PEF commercial production and initial product sales under offtake agreements
- **2027**: Target to reach EBITDA break-even, supported by €84.8M capital raise completed in recent financing round

### Industry Recognition

As an active member of European Bioplastics (EUBP) and other industry organizations, Avantium contributes to advancing bioplastics standards, technology development, and market education. The company's innovative PEF technology has garnered significant attention from major brands seeking sustainable alternatives to conventional PET.
