Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are a family of biodegradable polyesters naturally produced by bacteria and synthesized through biotechnology. PHAs are considered among the most promising bioplastics due to their versatility and complete biodegradability in various environments.

**Key Properties:**
- Fully biodegradable in soil, marine, and industrial composting environments
- Produced from renewable feedstocks (including food waste and algae)
- Wide range of material properties (from soft to rigid)
- Suitable for short-lived applications like packaging and food service items
- Lower processing temperatures than PLA

**Subtypes:**
- **PHB** (Polyhydroxybutyrate) - stiff, brittle; used for rigid applications
- **PHBV** (PHB-co-hydroxyvalerate) - more flexible; improved impact resistance
- **PHBH** (PHB-co-hexanoate) - high elasticity; for elastic films

**Major Producers:** EcoPHA Biotech, Kaneka, TianAn Biopolymer, PHA4Good

**Applications:** Food service items, flexible films, marine applications, medical devices, agricultural films
