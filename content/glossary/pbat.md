Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT) is a biodegradable polyester that combines petrochemical and biobased components. It is primarily used as a blend component with PLA or starch to improve flexibility and compostability.

**Key Properties:**
- Biodegradable in industrial composting environments (EN 13432 certified)
- High flexibility and ductility
- Good processing compatibility
- Enhanced mechanical properties when blended with PLA
- Lower melting point than PLA (approximately 100-120°C)

**Composition:**
- Can be 100% petroleum-based or bio-based
- Often blended with PLA (typically 20-30% PBAT) to improve compostability
- Enhances elongation at break and impact resistance

**Major Producers:** BASF (Ecoflex®), TotalEnergies Corbion (Luminy®), Zeon Corporation

**Applications:** Flexible films, bags, mulch films, single-use packaging, blends for improved compostability

**Note:** PBAT itself is not widely used independently but is valued for blending with PLA to meet EN 13432 compostability standards.
