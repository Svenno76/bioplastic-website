Starch-based bioplastics are materials created from renewable starch sources (corn, potato, wheat, cassava) modified through thermal and chemical processing to create thermoplastic materials with plastic-like properties.

**Key Properties:**
- Fully biodegradable and compostable (EN 13432 certified)
- Derived from abundant agricultural feedstocks
- Very low cost compared to other bioplastics
- Higher moisture sensitivity compared to PLA or PHA
- Variable properties depending on starch source and processing

**Types:**
- **Thermoplastic Starch (TPS):** Starch chemically modified to plasticize and create thermoplastic behavior
- **Starch Blends:** Starch combined with PLA, PCL, or other polymers to improve properties
- **Starch-based Films:** Used for packaging, bags, and single-use items

**Composition:**
- Typically 40-100% starch content
- Often blended with polyesters or other biopolymers
- Plasticizers (glycerin, sorbitol) used to modify properties

**Major Producers:** Cardia Bioplastics, BASF (Ecoflex + starch blends), Novamont, Rodenburg Biopolymers

**Applications:** Packaging films, bags, agricultural mulch films, loose-fill packaging, food service items, agricultural applications

**Advantages:**
- Most cost-effective bioplastic option
- Uses agricultural byproducts
- Fully compostable without additives

**Limitations:**
- Moisture absorption affects mechanical properties
- Lower strength compared to PLA
- Variable performance depending on humidity conditions
