Bio-PE (bio-based polyethylene) is a renewable equivalent of conventional polyethylene produced from biobased feedstocks such as sugarcane ethanol instead of fossil fuels. It is chemically identical to petroleum-based PE, making it a "drop-in replacement."

**Key Properties:**
- Chemically identical to fossil fuel-based PE (not biodegradable)
- Identical processing and performance characteristics
- Produced from renewable feedstocks (primarily sugarcane ethanol)
- Full compatibility with existing plastic processing equipment and infrastructure
- Identical end-of-life options (recycling, incineration)

**Production Process:**
- Sugarcane ethanol → ethylene → polyethylene (same as petrochemical routes)
- Avoids fossil fuel consumption
- Reduces carbon footprint by approximately 60-70% compared to conventional PE

**Major Producers:** Braskem (Green PE), Solvay, Novamont

**Applications:** Flexible and rigid films, bags, bottles, packaging, containers, bags, agricultural films

**Market Advantage:** Can use existing manufacturing infrastructure; customers can switch without equipment modifications

**Important Note:** Bio-PE is renewable but NOT biodegradable; end-of-life recycling is the same as conventional PE
