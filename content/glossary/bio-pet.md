Bio-PET (bio-based polyethylene terephthalate) is a partially or fully renewable version of conventional PET produced from renewable feedstocks. The most common approach replaces the ethylene glycol component with bio-based alternatives.

**Key Properties:**
- Chemically identical to fossil fuel-based PET (not biodegradable)
- Same processing and performance characteristics as conventional PET
- Typically 20-30% biobased content (from bio-ethylene glycol) in current commercial versions
- Full compatibility with existing PET processing and recycling infrastructure
- Reduces fossil fuel consumption and carbon footprint

**Production Approaches:**
- **Partial bio-PET:** Bio-based ethylene glycol (from sugarcane or other feedstocks) + fossil-based terephthalic acid
- **Full bio-PET:** Completely biobased (still experimental/limited commercialization)

**Major Producers:** Coca-Cola (Plantbottle™ Technology partnership with Novamont), Suntory, Indorama Ventures, Eastman

**Applications:** Beverage bottles, food containers, textile fibers, consumer goods packaging

**Market Status:** Growing commercial adoption; increasingly used by major beverage brands for sustainability messaging

**Important Note:** Bio-PET is renewable but NOT biodegradable; maintains conventional PET recycling options
