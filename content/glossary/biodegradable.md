Biodegradable refers to materials that can be broken down by microorganisms (bacteria, fungi) into natural substances such as water, carbon dioxide, and biomass.

**Important Notes:**
- Biodegradation rates vary by material and environment
- "Biodegradable" doesn't always mean "compostable"
- Industrial composting often required for bioplastics
- Marine biodegradability is a separate certification

**Standards:** EN 13432, ASTM D6400, ISO 14855
