Bio-PP (bio-based polypropylene) is a renewable equivalent of conventional polypropylene produced from bio-based feedstocks, particularly sugarcane ethanol. Like bio-PE, it is chemically identical to fossil fuel-based PP, making it a "drop-in replacement."

**Key Properties:**
- Chemically identical to fossil fuel-based PP (not biodegradable)
- Identical processing and performance characteristics to conventional PP
- Produced from renewable feedstocks (sugarcane ethanol)
- Full compatibility with existing polypropylene equipment and infrastructure
- Identical end-of-life options (recycling, incineration)

**Production Route:**
- Sugarcane ethanol → propylene → polypropylene
- Avoids fossil fuel consumption
- Reduces carbon footprint by approximately 60-70%
- Uses same industrial processes as conventional PP production

**Major Producers:** Braskem (bio-PP), Solvay, LyondellBasell

**Applications:** Rigid and flexible packaging, automotive parts, consumer goods, food containers, textiles and fibers, injection-molded articles

**Market Advantages:**
- Uses existing manufacturing infrastructure
- No equipment modifications required for processing
- Compatible with conventional plastic recycling streams
- Seamless transition for brand owners seeking sustainable alternatives

**Current Status:** Growing commercial availability with increasing capacity from major producers

**Important Note:** Bio-PP is renewable but NOT biodegradable; end-of-life management is identical to conventional PP
