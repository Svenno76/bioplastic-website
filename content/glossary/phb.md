## Overview

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the simplest and most abundant member of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family, representing nature's own solution to polymer production. Unlike synthetic plastics manufactured through chemical processes, PHB is produced entirely by bacteria as an intracellular energy storage compound—essentially bacterial fat. This biological origin makes PHB one of the most environmentally sustainable polymers available, fully biodegradable in virtually all natural environments while being produced from renewable feedstocks through fermentation.

PHB's story began in 1926 when French microbiologist Maurice Lemoigne discovered bacterial inclusions that turned out to be polyester granules. For decades, PHB remained a scientific curiosity until oil crises and environmental concerns sparked interest in renewable, biodegradable alternatives to petroleum plastics. Today, PHB and its copolymers represent the forefront of truly sustainable polymer science—materials that nature knows how to make and break down.

While PHB offers exceptional environmental credentials, it faces commercial challenges from brittleness, narrow processing windows, and higher costs compared to both conventional plastics and other bioplastics like PLA. However, ongoing research into copolymers, processing additives, and novel production methods continues to address these limitations while preserving PHB's unique environmental advantages.

## Production and Biosynthesis

**Bacterial Fermentation Process:**

PHB production represents true biological manufacturing:

1. **Bacterial Selection:** Specific bacteria naturally produce PHB, including:
   - *Cupriavidus necator* (formerly *Ralstonia eutropha*) - most studied PHB producer
   - *Alcaligenes latus*
   - Recombinant *E. coli* engineered for PHB production
   - Various cyanobacteria and purple bacteria

2. **Fermentation:** Bacteria are cultivated under nutrient-limited conditions (typically nitrogen or phosphorus deficiency) that trigger PHB accumulation as energy reserves:
   - Carbon source (glucose, sugars, oils, methane, CO2) is provided in excess
   - PHB accumulates as granules inside bacterial cells (up to 80-90% of cell dry weight)
   - Fermentation takes 24-96 hours depending on bacterial strain and conditions

3. **Harvesting:** Bacterial cells are lysed (broken open) using:
   - Chemical methods (surfactants, solvents)
   - Enzymatic digestion
   - Mechanical disruption

4. **Purification:** PHB granules are separated from cell debris and purified

5. **Processing:** Purified PHB is dried and pelletized for manufacturing

**Feedstock Flexibility:**
One of PHB's advantages is the diversity of carbon sources bacteria can convert:
- First-generation: Glucose, sucrose from corn or sugarcane
- Second-generation: Glycerol from biodiesel production, molasses from sugar refining
- Third-generation: Methane from landfills or agriculture, industrial off-gases (CO2, CO)
- Fourth-generation: Direct CO2 fixation using cyanobacteria or engineered bacteria
- Waste streams: Used cooking oil, food processing waste, whey from dairy

## Chemical Structure and Properties

**Molecular Structure:**
PHB is a linear polyester with repeating 3-hydroxybutyrate units:
- Molecular weight: typically 200,000-600,000 Da
- Highly crystalline structure (60-80% crystallinity)
- Isotactic stereoregular configuration
- Similar backbone to polypropylene but with ester linkages

**Physical Properties:**
- Melting point: 170-180°C
- Glass transition temperature: 5-10°C
- Density: 1.25 g/cm³
- Highly crystalline and rigid

**Mechanical Properties:**
- Tensile strength: 25-40 MPa (comparable to polypropylene)
- Elongation at break: 3-8% (very brittle - major limitation)
- Young's modulus: 3-4 GPa (stiff and rigid)
- High crystallinity causes brittleness and limited flexibility

**Thermal Properties:**
- Narrow processing window: melting point (170-180°C) close to degradation temperature (190-200°C)
- Thermal degradation during processing limits molecular weight
- Requires careful temperature control during manufacturing

**Biodegradability:**
PHB exhibits exceptional biodegradability across all environments:
- Industrial composting: 60-90 days (complete degradation)
- Soil: 6-12 months
- Marine water: 6-24 months (certified marine biodegradable)
- Freshwater: 8-18 months
- Anaerobic digestion: Degrades producing biogas

Biodegradation occurs through:
- Enzymatic hydrolysis by extracellular depolymerases
- Microbial consumption of degradation products
- Complete mineralization to CO2, water, and biomass

## Applications and Markets

## Advantages and Environmental Benefits

**Complete Biodegradability:**
PHB biodegrades in virtually all natural environments without requiring specific industrial conditions—a key advantage over PLA and many other bioplastics.

**Marine Biodegradability:**
Unlike most bioplastics, PHB is certified marine biodegradable, addressing ocean plastic pollution concerns.

**True Biological Origin:**
PHB is produced by living organisms through natural metabolic processes, not chemical synthesis, making it inherently renewable and sustainable.

**Carbon Sequestration:**
During biomass feedstock growth (plants, algae), CO2 is captured from the atmosphere. PHB production from CO2-utilizing bacteria can be carbon-negative.

**No Fossil Fuel Dependence:**
PHB can be produced entirely from renewable resources without petroleum inputs.

**Biocompatibility:**
Excellent biocompatibility enables medical applications, with PHB approved for certain medical devices.

## Challenges and Limitations

**Brittleness:**
Pure PHB's low elongation at break (3-8%) makes it unsuitable for applications requiring flexibility or impact resistance. Solutions include:
- Copolymerization with hydroxyvalerate (PHBV) or hydroxyhexanoate (PHBH)
- Blending with plasticizers or other polymers
- Processing modifications to reduce crystallinity

**Processing Challenges:**
- Narrow window between melting and degradation temperatures
- Thermal degradation reduces molecular weight during processing
- Requires specialized processing conditions and equipment modifications
- Limited shelf life due to continued crystallization during storage

**Cost:**
PHB production is expensive:
- Fermentation costs (media, energy, time)
- Downstream processing (cell lysis, purification, drying)
- Lower production volumes maintain high prices
- Typical cost: $3.00-6.00/kg compared to $1.00-1.50/kg for conventional plastics

PHB costs 2-3 times more than PLA and is comparable to or higher than other PHAs.

**Limited Production Capacity:**
Global PHB production is relatively small (estimated 20,000-40,000 tonnes annually), limiting commercial availability and maintaining high costs.

**Property Variability:**
Batch-to-batch variations in PHB properties (molecular weight, crystallinity) can occur due to fermentation inconsistencies.

## Recent Innovations and Future Outlook
