Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the simplest and most abundant member of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) family. It is produced through bacterial fermentation and represents one of the most sustainable biopolymers available.

**Key Properties:**
- Fully biodegradable in soil, marine, and industrial composting environments
- Produced by bacteria (naturally synthesized biopolymers)
- Rigid material with limited flexibility (high brittleness)
- Biodegrades within 1 year in soil conditions
- Thermally unstable during processing (narrow processing window)

**Production Method:**
- Bacteria ferment renewable feedstocks (glucose, organic waste)
- Bacteria synthesize PHB as energy storage compound
- PHB extracted and processed into plastic materials
- Represents true biological production of polymers

**Advantages:**
- Most sustainable biopolymer (produced by microorganisms)
- Fully biodegradable in diverse environments (marine, soil, compost)
- No toxic residues after biodegradation
- Can be produced from waste feedstocks and algae

**Limitations:**
- Brittle mechanical properties (limited elongation at break)
- Difficult processing due to thermal degradation
- Higher production costs compared to PLA
- Limited shelf life (degrades slowly even in storage)

**Major Producers:** TianAn Biopolymer, Metabolix (Mirel®), Tianzhu Biopolymer

**Applications:** Rigid packaging, agricultural films, short-shelf-life applications, marine environments, specialty applications requiring marine biodegradability

**Emerging Opportunity:** Blending with other polymers (PHB/V, PHB/HV) to improve processability and mechanical properties
