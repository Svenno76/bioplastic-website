## Overview

EN 13432 is a European standard (EN) developed by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). It specifies requirements for packaging and non-packaging products made from plastic materials that are designed to be recovered through composting and biodegradation in municipal or industrial composting plants.

It is widely considered the gold standard for compostable plastics worldwide and is referenced internationally as the definitive benchmark for compostability certification.

## Full Title and Scope

**Official Title:** "Requirements for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation - Test scheme and evaluation criteria for the final acceptance of packaging"

**Scope:** Applies to plastics used in packaging and other single-use items designed to be composted in industrial facilities

## Key Requirements

EN 13432 establishes three primary criteria that materials must meet:

### 1. Biodegradation (90% within 180 days)

**Testing Method:** ISO 14855-1 (Aerobic biodegradation testing)
- Material must biodegrade 90% within 180 days at 58°C in industrial composting conditions
- Carbon dioxide evolution measured to determine biodegradation percentage
- Testing conducted in laboratory-controlled conditions simulating industrial composting
- Biodegradable portion must be converted to CO2, H2O, and biomass

**Significance:** Ensures material actually degrades within composting timeframe, not merely breaking apart physically

### 2. Disintegration (<2mm within 180 days)

**Testing Method:** Visual inspection and sieving after composting
- Material must break down into fragments smaller than 2mm
- At least 90% of original material must be present as fragments <2mm
- Ensures complete physical breakdown in composting environment
- Prevents large pieces from remaining in finished compost

**Significance:** Guarantees the final compost product doesn't contain visible plastic particles

### 3. Ecotoxicity Testing

**Testing Methods:**
- Plant growth tests using finished compost from test material
- Ecotoxicity assessment to verify no harmful residues
- Ensuring finished compost is safe for plants and soil organisms
- No inhibition of plant growth compared to control compost

**Significance:** Verifies that biodegradation produces only environmentally safe byproducts

## Testing Conditions

**Temperature:** 58°C (±2°C)
- Industrial composting temperature range
- Higher than home composting temperatures
- Reflects best-case composting scenario

**Duration:** 180 days maximum
- Clear timeframe for certification
- Allows for significant material variation while maintaining standard

**Microbial Population:** Active compost microorganisms
- Natural microbial community from operating composting facility
- Ensures realistic degradation conditions

## Certification Process

**Accredited Laboratories:**
- Testing must be performed by certified, independent laboratories
- Following standardized test protocols
- Results subject to verification by certification bodies

**Certification Bodies:**
- TÜV Austria (OK Compost certification)
- Other accredited European certification organizations
- Issue official certificates for compliant materials
- Regular monitoring and re-testing required

**Documentation:**
- Full test reports required
- Product specifications and composition provided
- Chain of custody documented
- Regular audits for certified producers

## Comparison with Other Standards

**EN 13432 vs. ASTM D6400 (North America):**
- EN 13432: More stringent, requires 90% biodegradation in 180 days
- ASTM D6400: Similar requirements but allows home composting certification
- Both increasingly aligned for international trade

**EN 13432 vs. ASTM D6868 (Home Compostable):**
- EN 13432: Industrial composting only
- ASTM D6868: Specifically for home composting conditions
- More stringent requirements (lower temperatures, variable conditions)

**EN 13432 vs. Other Biodegradation Standards:**
- Stricter than many national standards
- More comprehensive than simple biodegradation tests
- Only standard requiring both biodegradation AND disintegration verification
- Includes ecotoxicity assessment (unique requirement)

## Products Certified to EN 13432

**Common Applications:**
- Compostable food packaging (bags, clamshells, trays)
- Certified compostable cutlery and plates
- Compostable film and wrap products
- Certified compostable trash liners
- Food service packaging
- Agricultural mulch films (variant: EN 17033)

**Notable Certified Materials:**
- Corn starch-based polymers
- PLA (with additives)
- PBAT
- PBS
- Starch/polymer blends
- Proprietary compostable formulations

## Logo and Market Recognition

**OK Compost Logo:**
- Used by certified products
- Indicates compliance with EN 13432
- Recognized consumer label across Europe
- Green and white certification mark

## Importance for Bioplastics Industry

EN 13432 serves as the definitive standard for compostable materials because it:

1. **Ensures Real Degradation:** Not merely physical breakdown but actual biodegradation
2. **Sets Clear Timeframes:** 180 days provides predictable, verifiable degradation
3. **Prevents Greenwashing:** Stringent requirements prevent false claims
4. **Protects Compost Quality:** Disintegration and ecotoxicity requirements ensure finished compost safety
5. **Facilitates Market Confidence:** Recognized globally, enabling cross-border trade
6. **Supports Infrastructure:** Clear standard helps composting facilities manage material inputs

## Limitations and Criticisms

**Infrastructure Dependency:**
- Requires industrial composting facilities
- Not applicable for landfill or marine environments
- No guarantee material will compost without appropriate infrastructure

**Industrial Composting Only:**
- Does not address home composting scenarios
- Temperature requirements may not be met in all regions
- Global applicability limited by infrastructure availability

**Marketing Challenges:**
- Consumer confusion: "Compostable" alone doesn't mean curbside collection
- Lack of widespread collection systems in many regions
- Risk of contamination if mixed with conventional recycling

## Current Status and Updates

**EN 13432:2000** - Original standard, still widely used
**EN 13432:2023** - Updated version with refinements
- Clarified testing procedures
- Enhanced quality assurance requirements
- Alignment with ISO 14855 revisions
- Strengthened monitoring provisions

## Conclusion

EN 13432 represents the global benchmark for compostable plastic certification. Its rigorous requirements—biodegradation, disintegration, and ecotoxicity—ensure that certified materials provide genuine environmental benefits through industrial composting. However, the standard's value depends entirely on the existence and accessibility of industrial composting infrastructure, making its implementation part of a broader sustainability solution rather than a standalone fix.
