Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a synthetic biodegradable polyester known for its flexibility, low processing temperature, and strong adhesion to other materials. It is particularly valuable for medical and durable applications.

**Key Properties:**
- Fully biodegradable in soil, compost, and marine environments
- Low melting point (approximately 60°C)
- High flexibility and elongation at break
- Excellent adhesion and blend compatibility
- Slow degradation rate (1-2 years in soil)
- Non-toxic; biocompatible for medical applications

**Unique Characteristics:**
- Can be processed at very low temperatures (compared to PLA)
- Excellent for blending with other polymers to improve properties
- Maintains flexibility over a wide temperature range
- Suitable for both injection molding and extrusion

**Major Producers:** Solvay (Capa®), Daicel Corporation, BASF, Corbion

**Applications:** Medical devices (sutures, wound dressings, implants), controlled-release drug delivery systems, flexible films, adhesive layers, blending component for other bioplastics

**Market Status:** Niche market dominated by medical and pharmaceutical applications; higher cost limits broader commercial use

**Clinical Significance:** Extensively used in biomedical engineering due to biocompatibility and FDA approval for medical devices
