Polybutylene Succinate (PBS) is a biodegradable polyester synthesized from bio-based or petrochemical feedstocks. PBS is gaining significant interest due to its excellent mechanical properties and versatility.

**Key Properties:**
- Biodegradable in industrial composting and soil
- Good mechanical properties comparable to conventional plastics
- Higher heat resistance than PLA
- Better processability than PLA (lower processing temperatures)
- Can be produced from 100% biobased feedstocks

**Advantages:**
- Strong tensile strength and elongation at break
- Good chemical resistance
- Lower crystallization temperature enables faster cooling in injection molding
- Suitable for both rigid and flexible applications

**Major Producers:** BASF (BioPBS), Mitsubishi Chemical, Showa High Polymer, Fuweitech

**Applications:** Engineering plastics, textiles, fibers, bottles, injection-molded parts, automotive components, flexible films

**Market Status:** Emerging bioplastic with growing production capacity; expected to expand significantly as technology matures
