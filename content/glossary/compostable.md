Compostable refers to materials that are capable of undergoing aerobic biodegradation in industrial composting systems, breaking down into water, carbon dioxide, and biomass within a specific timeframe (typically 180 days or less).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Must biodegrade in industrial composting conditions (minimum 58°C for 180 days)
- Must disintegrate into fragments smaller than 2mm
- Must not have adverse environmental effects
- Certified to international standards (EN 13432, ASTM D6400, ISO 14855-1)

**Important Distinctions:**
- **Compostable ≠ Biodegradable:** Can be biodegradable but not compostable in home conditions
- **Compostable ≠ Biodegradable in soil:** Industrial composting requires specific conditions not found in landfills or soil
- **Compostable ≠ Home Compostable:** Most certified compostable materials require industrial facilities (55-58°C minimum)

**Certified Materials:**
- PLA (with PBAT additives for EN 13432)
- PBAT/PLA blends
- Starch-based plastics
- Many PHA formulations

**Certification Standards:**
- **EN 13432 (Europe)** - Most stringent; recognized globally
- **ASTM D6400 (USA)** - Certifies home and industrial compostability
- **ISO 14855** - Test methods for biodegradability

**Practical Considerations:**
- Industrial composting facilities must be available in user region
- Not suitable for landfills (biodegrades slowly without oxygen)
- Requires separate collection from standard plastics
- Growing infrastructure for food waste composting in many regions

**Consumer Communication:** Clear labeling and education essential; "compostable" alone doesn't guarantee proper end-of-life without available facilities
