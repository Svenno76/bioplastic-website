## Batch 4 Research Findings

### Correctly Classified (10 companies - No action needed)
1. ✓ Biome Bioplastics (Bioplastic Producer)
2. ✓ Bio-On (Bioplastic Producer)
3. ✓ Jiangsu Supla Bioplastics (Bioplastic Producer)
4. ✓ BASF (Bioplastic Producer)
5. ✓ Arkema S.A. (Bioplastic Producer)

7. ✓ Trinseo (Bioplastic Producer)
8. ✓ AgroRenew (Bioplastic Producer)
9. ✓ BBCA Group (Bioplastic Producer)
10. ✓ Algenesis (Bioplastic Producer)

### Requires Manual Review

#### 1. Blue Circle Olefins
- **Current Classification:** Bioplastic Producer
- **Business Model:** Produces base chemicals (ethylene, propylene) for polymer production
- **Issue:** Upstream from traditional bioplastic producers; may be better classified as Technology Company
- **Recommendation:** Review and decide between keeping as Producer or reclassifying to Technology Company

#### 2. Asahi Kasei Corporation
- **Current Classification:** Bioplastic Producer
- **Business Model:** Large diversified Japanese chemical company; bio-based chemicals
- **Issue:** Description too vague; unclear if producing polymers, chemicals, or other products
- **Recommendation:** Individual research needed to verify specific bioplastics business segment

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready to Execute)
